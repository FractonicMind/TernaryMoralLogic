# Oracle Network Security Model

## Overview

This document defines the security architecture, threat model, and defensive measures for TML's Decentralized Oracle Network (DON) supporting Earth Protection under a **Blockchain** paradigm.  
Feeds are **signed messages**, integrity is **on-chain Merkle roots**, and quorum is **threshold-contract enforcement**—not human consensus.

## Threat Landscape

## Security Architecture

### 1. Blockchain Integrity

```solidity
// Solidity pseudo-code
contract OracleIntegrity {
    // Each feed update must match on-chain Merkle root
    function verifyUpdate(bytes32 feedRoot, bytes32[] memory proof) external view returns (bool) {
        return MerkleProof.verify(proof, merkleRoot, feedRoot);
    }
}
```

```yaml
integrity_stack:
  layer_0: "secp256k1 signatures by each oracle key"
  layer_1: "Merkle root of all feeds anchored every 15 min"
  layer_2: "Merkle root anchored to Bitcoin + Ethereum + Polygon"
  layer_3: "OpenTimestamp proofs for legal admissibility"
  layer_4: "IPFS content-hash for large blobs (satellite imagery, PDFs)"
  
benefits:
  - No human reconciliation = no human error/bribery
  - Court-ready evidence (FRE 902(13) cryptographic proof)
  - Real-time detection of feed divergence
  - Automatic slashing for bad signatures
```

### 2. Threshold Quorum (On-Chain)

```solidity
contract OracleQuorum {
    uint256 public constant THRESHOLD = 7;
    uint256 public constant TOTAL_KEYS = 9;

    function submitFeed(bytes32 feedRoot, bytes calldata signature) external {
        require(isValidSigner(msg.sender), "Invalid oracle key");
        feeds[block.timestamp][feedRoot] += 1;
        
        if (feeds[block.timestamp][feedRoot] >= THRESHOLD) {
            anchorRoot(feedRoot);
        }
    }
}
```

```yaml
quorum_mechanics:
  threshold: "7-of-9 on-chain signatures"
  key_rotation: "Quarterly via Blockchains-time-locked call" # ← updated
  slashing: "10% bond + public exposure for bad sig"
  anonymity: "Keys are pseudonymous; real-world identity optional"
  multisig_backup: "3-of-5 social recovery for lost keys"
  
human_rights_oracle: "Same 7-of-9 for HR feeds"              # ← new
earth_protection_oracle: "Same 7-of-9 for eco feeds"          # ← new
```

### 3. Feed Encryption & Privacy

```yaml
encryption_stack:
  transport: "TLS 1.3 with Ed25519 certificates"
  payload: "AES-256-GCM with 256-bit random key"
  key_exchange: "ECDH secp256r1 per session"
  forward_secrecy: "Ephemeral keys rotated every 5 min"
  
indigenous_data:
  sovereignty: "Encrypted with community-controlled key"
  consent: "Key released only after on-chain FPIC attestation"
  erasure: "Community can burn key (crypto-shred) at any time"
  
human_rights_data: "Encrypted with victim-controlled key"     # ← new
earth_protection_data: "Encrypted with steward-controlled key" # ← new
```

## Defensive Measures

### 1. Anti-Poisoning (Data Integrity)

```python
def anti_poisoning_checks():
    return {
        "statistical_outlier_detection": z_score > 3,
        "cross_source_validation": min_agreement = 70%,
        "historical_consistency": delta < 2_sigma,
        "rate_of_change_limit": dX/dt < max_slope,
        "multi_oracle_convergence": stdev < tolerance,
        "human_rights_sanity": no_torture_flag,          # ← new
        "earth_protection_sanity": no_boundary_violation  # ← new
    }
```

### 2. Key Management (Hardware Security)

```yaml
hardware_stack:
  primary: "Ledger Nano X / Trezor Model T"
  backup: "SeedSigner offline device"
  airgap: "Never touches Internet; PSBT only"
  entropy: "TRNG + environmental noise + Blockchain hash"
  shard_storage: "Shamir 3-of-5 split across continents"
  
ceremony:
  frequency: "Quarterly key rotation"
  participants: "9 independent entities + live-stream"

```

### 4. Economic Defense

```solidity
// Slashing mechanics
function slashOracle(address oracle, uint256 amount) external {
    require(!isValidSignature(oracle, lastFeed), "Signature still valid");
    stakingContract.seize(oracle, amount); // 10% of bond
    emit OracleSlashed(oracle, amount);
}
```

```yaml
economic_defenses:
  staking_requirement: "$100K per oracle key (locked)"
  reward_pool: "$1M annually from Memorial Fund"
  gas_sponsorship: "Meta-tx relayer for community reporters"
  flash_loan_resistance: "No token voting; sig-based only"
  bond_escalation: "Double bond during emergency council"
  
human_rights_incentive: "15% penalty bounty to reporters"   # ← new
earth_protection_incentive: "15% penalty bounty to stewards" # ← new
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-Time Detection

## Performance Metrics

### Security KPIs (On-Chain)

    uint256 slashingEvents;       // count of bad signatures
    uint256 chainAnchorTime;      // seconds to 3-chain confirmation
    bool    humanRightsIntact;    // oracle boolean
    bool    earthProtectionIntact;// oracle boolean

```yaml
security_sla:
  signature_uptime: ">99.9%"
