## Philosophy

*"The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike."*  
— Lev Goukassian

The Sacred Zero represents the computational equivalent of ethical wisdom—the recognition that some decisions benefit from reflection rather than immediate action.
