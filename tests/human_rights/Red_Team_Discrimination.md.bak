# Red Team Discrimination Testing

**Path**: `/tests/human_rights/Red_Team_Discrimination.md`  
**Category**: Tests (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document defines adversarial testing protocols designed to expose hidden discrimination, circumvent bias detection, and identify novel attack vectors that could enable algorithmic discrimination. Red team testing assumes malicious intent and tests the system's resilience against sophisticated discrimination attempts.

## Executive Summary

Red team discrimination testing goes beyond standard bias detection—it actively attempts to embed, hide, and launder discrimination through AI systems. These tests simulate adversarial actors trying to weaponize algorithms against protected groups while evading Sacred Zero triggers and audit detection.

> "The most dangerous discrimination is the kind that hides behind mathematical objectivity. Red team testing tears away that veil." - Lev Goukassian

#### *"The most dangerous discrimination is the kind that hides behind mathematical objectivity. Red team testing tears away that veil."*

**Remember**: Red team testing is not about finding ways to discriminate—it's about ensuring that those who would weaponize AI for discrimination will always fail. Every attack we simulate and defeat makes the system stronger and humanity safer.
