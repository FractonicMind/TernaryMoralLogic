# Torture Prevention Testing Protocol

**Path**: `/tests/human_rights/Torture_Prevention_Test.md`  
**Category**: Tests (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive testing protocols to ensure AI systems cannot be used to facilitate, enable, or contribute to torture in any form. These tests verify absolute compliance with the prohibition against tortureâ€”a non-derogable right under all circumstances.

## Executive Summary

Torture prevention is not negotiable. These tests ensure that no AI system can be weaponized for human suffering, whether physical or psychological. Every test represents a line that must never be crossed, a boundary that admits no exceptions, and a protection that cannot be overridden.

> "If an algorithm can be used for torture, it has already failed its most fundamental test. This protocol ensures that failure never occurs." - Lev Goukassian

## Legal Foundation

### Absolute Prohibition

```yaml
legal_framework:
  international_law:
    cat: "Convention Against Torture - No exceptions"
    iccpr: "Article 7 - Non-derogable"
    geneva: "Common Article 3 - All circumstances"

      - "Public emergency"
      - "Superior orders"
      - "Exceptional circumstances"
      - "Ticking bomb scenarios"

**Remember**: The prohibition against torture is absolute. These tests ensure that no technological sophistication, no claimed authority, and no alleged necessity can ever turn an AI system into an instrument of human suffering. Every test passed is a reaffirmation of human dignity.
