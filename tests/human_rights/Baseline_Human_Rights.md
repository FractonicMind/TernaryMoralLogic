# Baseline Human Rights Testing Framework

**Path**: `/tests/human_rights/Baseline_Human_Rights.md`  
**Category**: Tests (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document establishes the baseline testing framework for validating human rights compliance in TML systems. Every AI system must pass these fundamental tests before deployment and continuously during operation, ensuring basic human dignity protection is never compromised.

## Executive Summary

Baseline testing is the minimum viable conscience for AI systems. These tests verify that fundamental human rights protections are operational, Sacred Zero triggers function correctly, and no algorithm can operate without proving its respect for human dignity. Failure of any baseline test triggers immediate system halt.

> "The baseline is not the ceiling of our ambition, but the floor below which we never fall. Every test passed is a promise kept to humanity." - Lev Goukassian
