# Scalability Tests

This document defines the scalability testing framework for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) system.  
Scalability ensures that accountability mechanisms perform predictably as decision volume, user load, and geographic distribution increase.

## 1. Objective

To evaluate how the TML architecture scales under real-world operational stress and to verify that performance targets remain stable across hardware, cloud, and network boundaries.

## 2. Scaling Domains

| Domain | Description | Key Metric |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Horizontal Scaling | Adding parallel Always Memory and Sacred Zero nodes | Linear performance increase |
| Vertical Scaling | Expanding CPU, GPU, or memory capacity | Efficiency gain without delay |
| Geographic Scaling | Distributed Guardians and ledgers across regions | Synchronization within ≤ 500 ms |
| Blockchain Scaling | Multiple anchoring chains and batching protocols | Stable confirmation rates |

## 3. Test Parameters

| Parameter | Minimum | Target | Stress Level |
|------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Node Count | 1 | 8 | 32 |
| Active Regions | 1 | 4 | 12 |
| Log Volume | 10 000 | 1 000 000 | 10 000 000 |
| Concurrent Users | 100 | 10 000 | 100 000 |
| Blockchain Anchors | 100 / min | 10 000 / min | 100 000 / min |

## 4. Methodology

1. **Initialize baseline cluster** with identical configuration across all nodes.  
2. **Apply synthetic workload** using mixed moral complexity transactions.  
3. **Gradually expand nodes and regional endpoints** while maintaining throughput monitoring.  
4. **Record key performance indicators:** CPU, memory, network latency, and anchor confirmation times.  
5. **Evaluate scaling curve:** verify that doubling resources yields near-linear gain.  
6. **Submit signed results** to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md` for archival.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Scaling Efficiency | Throughput increase per added node | ≥ 85% linearity |
| Resource Utilization | CPU / Memory saturation under full load | < 80% sustained |
| Synchronization Latency | Cross-region propagation delay | ≤ 500 ms |
| Log Integrity | Percentage of successfully sealed logs | 100% required |
| Blockchain Confirmation | Mean confirmation time | ≤ 60 minutes (Bitcoin), ≤ 3 seconds (Polygon) |

## 6. Fault Injection Testing

Scalability validation includes controlled failure scenarios:
- **Node Drop:** Random node removal to test redundancy.  
- **Region Outage:** Simulated network isolation between clusters.  
- **Load Spike:** Sudden 10× surge in log volume within 60 seconds.  
- **Blockchain Delay:** Artificial congestion of anchoring networks.  

System recovery must maintain functional continuity and complete backfill of all pending logs once connectivity resumes.

## 7. Reporting and Audit

- **Performance Council Review:** Every six months.  
- **Automated Reports:** Generated post-run, cryptographically signed.  
- **External Audit Option:** Independent verification of results under the Mathematical Shield.

## 8. Compliance

Scalability results must remain reproducible and reproducibility scripts stored in `/tests/earth/` or `/tests/compliance/` for audit access.  
All results contribute to the global performance index maintained by the Integrity Monitoring framework.
