# Performance and Latency

The Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework is designed for real-time ethical accountability without operational delay.
Every decision executes instantly, while its moral trace is written, sealed, and anchored in parallel.

## Design Principle

**No Memory = No Action.**


TML separates execution from logging. Sacred Zero triggers and Always Memory run asynchronously, ensuring moral reflection never interferes with safety-critical speed.

## Performance Targets

* **Visible overhead (user path):** ≤ 2 ms target, ≤ 10 ms under stress
* **Complete sealing + hashing:** ≤ 500 ms (P95)
* **Throughput:** 10 000 + decisions / second
* **Uptime:** 99.9 % with graceful degradation
* **Storage:** 100 KB per 10 000 decisions

These numbers define the time it takes accountability to catch up behind action—not how fast action itself occurs.

## Engineering Analogy

Like an aircraft’s flight recorder, TML’s logging runs parallel to the engines.
The plane never waits to climb; the recorder never misses a frame.
Safety is instantaneous, accountability follows within milliseconds.

## Benchmark Path

Real-world performance is validated through:

* **Autonomous Systems** – reaction-critical testing in self-driving frameworks
* **Financial AI** – sub-millisecond evaluation under market load
* **Medical Decision Engines** – simultaneous patient triage and trace capture
* **Distributed Guardians** – latency propagation studies across global institutions

## Scalability Roadmap

* Continuous optimization for edge inference chips and neuromorphic hardware
* Layer-2 Blockchain batching for sub-cent-per-log costs
* Dynamic load adaptation for multi-region Always Memory clusters
* Open telemetry pipeline for independent verification

## Governance Metrics

Performance evaluation results are published quarterly under the
[Integrity Monitoring Report](/protection/integrity-monitoring.md).
Latency audits fall under the Hybrid Shield’s Mathematical layer,
with optional institutional mirroring when Guardians are active.
