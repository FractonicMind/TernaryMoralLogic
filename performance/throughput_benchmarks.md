# Throughput Benchmarks

This document presents the throughput evaluation standards for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.  
Throughput defines how many moral evaluations and log operations can be processed per second under sustained load.

## 1. Purpose

To validate that large-scale deployments of TML maintain both speed and reliability when processing high volumes of moral trace logs across distributed systems.

## 2. Benchmark Scope

Benchmarks are divided into two operational domains:

- **Inference Domain:** AI decision throughput under Sacred Zero monitoring.  
- **Logging Domain:** Moral Trace Log creation, batching, and blockchain anchoring.

Each domain is measured independently and combined for total system throughput.

## 3. Target Metrics

| Category | Description | Target | Sustained Capacity |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------------------|
| Decision Evaluation | Ethical checks per second | 10 000 + | 600 000 per minute |
| Log Creation | Hash generation and queueing | 8 000 + | 480 000 per minute |
| Merkle Batching | Log aggregation and sealing | 1 000 batches/s | 100 logs per batch |
| Blockchain Anchoring | Anchors to Polygon / Ethereum | 500 / s | Confirmation < 3 s |
| Audit Synchronization | Cross-chain verification | 50 / s | Depends on node distance |

## 4. Benchmark Environments

| Environment | Configuration | Node Count | Duration |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Local Test | Single instance | 1 | 5 minutes |
| Cluster | Cloud or datacenter | 8 | 30 minutes |
| Global Distribution | Multi-region guardians | 40 | 60 minutes |

All tests run using real decision datasets generated from TML simulations and production-grade ethical workloads.

## 5. Validation Procedure

1. Initialize benchmark nodes with synchronized clocks (±5 ms).  
2. Generate workload representing mixed moral complexity.  
3. Execute TML engine under constant 70% CPU utilization.  
4. Record transactions per second and error rates.  
5. Verify hash-chain integrity after each run.  
6. Submit results to the Integrity Monitoring module.

## 6. Monitoring Metrics

| Metric | Description | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| CPU Utilization | Engine efficiency under load | 60–80% |
| Memory Usage | Peak during batching | < 512 MB per node |
| Queue Depth | Pending logs awaiting seal | < 1000 entries |
| Log Error Rate | Failed or missing records | < 0.001% |
| Network Latency | Cross-node sync delay | < 50 ms average |

## 7. Reporting Schedule

- **Monthly throughput summaries** are compiled by the Performance Council.  
- **Quarterly benchmark validation** performed by independent reviewers.  
- **Annual optimization report** appended to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md`.

## 8. Compliance

All benchmark data are cryptographically signed and stored under the Mathematical Shield.  
Unauthorized modification or omission of performance results constitutes a reportable violation under TML governance policy.
