# Latency Metrics

This document defines latency measurement methods, performance classes, and verification procedures for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.  
All metrics apply to production-grade deployments operating under real-time ethical decision workloads.

## 1. Purpose

To ensure accountability and responsiveness, TML establishes strict latency budgets for every component in the decision–logging pipeline.  
These values are continuously verified through automated benchmarks and external audit reports.

## 2. Measurement Scope

Latency is measured across two distinct domains:

- **Execution Path:** The primary AI decision loop.  
  Target: No measurable delay from TML operations.  

- **Accountability Path:** Sacred Zero evaluation, hashing, and blockchain anchoring.  
  Target: Completion within 500 ms at P95 percentile.

## 3. Latency Classification

| Layer | Description | Target (ms) | Measurement Tool |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Decision Execution | Core AI inference and decision | ≤ 2 | Native instrumentation |
| Sacred Zero Trigger | Moral complexity detection and classification | ≤ 10 | TML internal profiler |
| Always Memory Write | Hash creation and local persistence | ≤ 100 | System-level I/O monitor |
| Log Sealing | Merkle batching and finalization | ≤ 250 | Batch validator |
| Blockchain Anchoring | External network confirmation | ≤ 500 | Multi-chain anchor verifier |

## 4. Verification Process

- **Sampling Rate:** Every 1 000th transaction is sampled for latency verification.  
- **Aggregation:** Median, P95, and P99 metrics are recorded.  
- **Reporting:** Monthly summary posted to the Integrity Monitoring system.  
- **Alert Thresholds:** Any P95 breach > 20% triggers investigation by performance council.  

## 5. Test Environments

| Environment | Description | Hardware Baseline | Operating Mode |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Local | Developer or academic setup | 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM | Single node |
| Cluster | Production or cloud setup | 32-core CPU, 128GB RAM | Multi-node parallel |
| Guardian Network | Institutional replication layer | Variable | Multi-region distributed |

## 6. Benchmark Schedule

- **Automated Daily Runs:** Local and cluster environments.  
- **Quarterly Reports:** Aggregated latency data published to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md`.  
- **Independent Validation:** Optional third-party latency verification under Governance Council review.  

## 7. Compliance

All latency data must remain reproducible and verifiable.  
Audit trails are retained for a minimum of five years, ensuring traceability of system performance across software revisions.
