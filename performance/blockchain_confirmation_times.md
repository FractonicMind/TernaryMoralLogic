# Blockchain Confirmation Times

This document provides standardized confirmation benchmarks for blockchain anchoring within the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.  
These metrics quantify how long it takes for each supported network to finalize anchoring events and make Moral Trace Logs permanently immutable.

## 1. Objective

To establish measurable and reproducible confirmation times across different blockchains used in the Mathematical Shield layer of TML.  
Performance values ensure predictable anchoring speed without compromising legal integrity or cryptographic permanence.

## 2. Supported Networks

| Network | Role | Confirmation Type | Primary Function |
|----------|------|------------------|------------------|
| Bitcoin | Permanent archival ledger | Proof-of-Work | Highest immutability guarantee |
| Ethereum | Smart-contract enforcement | Proof-of-Stake | Programmable penalty logic |
| Polygon | Rapid confirmation layer | Proof-of-Stake | Real-time operational anchoring |
| OpenTimestamps | Lightweight timestamping | Merkle Proof | Cost-effective archival verification |

Each blockchain contributes a complementary layer of assurance, combining speed, programmability, and permanence.

## 3. Benchmark Results

| Blockchain | Average Confirmation (s) | P95 (s) | Stability Index | Typical Use |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Bitcoin | 3600 | 4200 | 0.99 | Permanent legal evidence |
| Ethereum | 15 | 45 | 0.98 | Smart-contract penalties |
| Polygon | 2 | 5 | 0.97 | Immediate accountability |
| OpenTimestamps | 0.5 | 1 | 0.95 | Batch archival timestamps |

*Stability Index* reflects long-term consistency of transaction finality over a 12-month rolling window.

## 4. Confirmation Classification

| Class | Definition | Blockchain Examples |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Class A | ≤ 5 seconds | Polygon, OTS |
| Class B | ≤ 60 seconds | Ethereum |
| Class C | ≤ 60 minutes | Bitcoin |
| Class D | > 60 minutes | Delayed or archival backups |

TML anchors to at least one Class A or B network in every operation to ensure immediate verifiability.

## 5. Verification Procedure

1. Submit log hash to all configured blockchain nodes simultaneously.  
2. Record block height and transaction hash for each submission.  
3. Poll confirmation status every second until verified inclusion.  
4. Store confirmation timestamp in Always Memory.  
5. Validate Merkle proof of inclusion for audit records.  
6. Export signed report to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md`.

## 6. Performance Monitoring

- **Automated Polling:** Continuous real-time confirmation tracking.  
- **Exception Alerts:** Triggered if confirmation exceeds 2× baseline average.  
- **Quarterly Benchmark Review:** Conducted by the Performance Council.  
- **Cross-Verification:** Random audits by external validators for consistency.

## 7. Cost and Efficiency Metrics

| Blockchain | Average Cost (USD) | Confirmation Energy Cost | Optimization Strategy |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Bitcoin | 1.00–2.50 | High | Batched Merkle anchors |
| Ethereum | 0.20–0.40 | Moderate | Layer-2 rollups |
| Polygon | 0.01–0.05 | Low | High-frequency anchoring |
| OpenTimestamps | 0 | Minimal | Aggregated free proofing |

Anchoring strategies are adjusted dynamically to minimize cost while maintaining compliance and immutability guarantees.

## 8. Compliance

All confirmation records are part of the immutable audit trail under the Hybrid Shield.  
Missing or delayed confirmations must be documented with corresponding retry logs and timestamps.  
Tampering or retroactive modification of anchoring data constitutes a breach of TML accountability standards.
