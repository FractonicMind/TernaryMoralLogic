# Environmental FAQ: Ternary Moral Logic and Planetary Protection

## Introduction  

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) was conceived to protect humanity from harm through the principles of **Sacred Zero** and **Always Memory**. Today, its mission expands: to safeguard not only people, but also the ecosystems that sustain life.  

This Environmental FAQ explains how TML enforces accountability for ecological harm, integrates global treaties and local truths, protects Indigenous communities, and ensures that every decision touching the planet leaves an auditable, court-admissible trace. The framework blends **technical precision** with **ethical responsibility**, uniting governance, law, and science into a single architecture.

## Section 1: Core Principles  

**Q1. What is Sacred Zero in Environmental Protection?**  
Sacred Zero is TML’s hesitation state. When a decision may cause ecological harm, the system halts and generates an **Always Memory log**. This log documents the risk, the ecological rule triggered, and the reasoning behind the hesitation. The decision cannot proceed until human overseers and affected communities are engaged.  

**Q2. What is Always Memory in this context?**  
Always Memory ensures that no ecological risk is forgotten or erased. Every log contains:  
- A hash of the exact ecological rule version (e.g., `ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml`),  
- The data source (global treaty hash, national regulation, or community oracle),  
- The decision state (+1 proceed, 0 Sacred Zero, –1 refuse).  

This guarantees **legal admissibility** and prevents regulators or corporations from claiming ignorance.

## Section 2: Data Foundations  

**Q3. Which global documents must AI companies train on?**  
AI operators are mandated to integrate datasets from recognized authorities, including:  
- International treaties (e.g., Paris Agreement, Convention on Biological Diversity),  
- National regulations (e.g., U.S. EPA standards, EU directives),  
- Scientific assessments (e.g., IPCC climate reports, UN biodiversity reports).  

These datasets form **Tier 1: The Global Baseline**.  

**Q4. How does TML ensure ecological rules stay current?**  
- Each rule file (e.g., `ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml`, `LEGAL_MAPPING.md`) is **version-controlled**.  
- The policy hash of the version used in a decision is embedded in `earth_extension.schema.json`.  
- Updates to treaties and regulations are automatically ingested and validated via the **Oracle Bridge**, preventing outdated compliance claims.

## Section 3: Protecting Local and Indigenous Communities  

**Q5. How are ethnic and Indigenous groups protected?**  
TML includes **Tier 2: The Local Witness Layer**. This empowers communities to record and submit ecological observations under the principle of **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**.  

- **Community Registration:** Communities define governance protocols in `community_registration.schema.json` (e.g., council consensus, village assembly).  
- **Peer Verification:** A `verification_quorum` ensures multiple community members must confirm critical alerts before they are published.  
- **Ownership:** Data remains under community control, governed by CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics).  

**Q6. How do communities submit data with limited internet access?**  
- Offline-first workflows are mandatory in `/docs/earth/COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md`.  
- Options include SMS-based alerts, portable sensors, and trusted NGO couriers with satellite uplinks.  
- This design ensures even the most remote groups can participate.  

**Q7. How are internal conflicts handled?**  
- If contradictory but valid alerts emerge from a community, the system defaults to **Sacred Zero**.  
- Escalation is triggered to the Ombudsperson.  
- A red-team test case `/tests/earth/red_team/internal_conflict_case.md` ensures this safeguard is continuously stress-tested.

## Section 4: Technical Safeguards  

**Q8. How does the Oracle system work in environmental protection?**  
Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) serve as bridges:  
- Fetching and validating both global (treaty-based) and local (community) data,  
- Anchoring data via **threshold cryptography** so no single node can falsify inputs,  
- Providing **zero-knowledge proofs** to auditors verifying that private community data matches on-chain hashes without exposing sensitive content.  

**Q9. How does TML ensure data integrity?**  
- Logs are signed within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for origin security.  
- Integrity is enforced by Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus across the Guardian network.  
- Each log’s cryptographic hash is immutable and tamper-evident.

## Section 5: Economics of Stewardship  

**Q10. How are communities incentivized?**  
The **Stewardship Fund** finances micro-grants for communities and Oracle nodes. It is fed by:  
- A share of all TML network transaction fees,  
- Penalties for non-compliant operators.  

**Q11. How does the system prevent “noise” from minor reports?**  
- `/policies/earth/ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml` defines **severity tiers** (Tier 1: irreversible damage; Tier 2: significant but reversible; Tier 3: minor breaches).  
- `/policies/earth/STEWARDSHIP_FUND.md` ties rewards to severity. Critical alerts earn higher rewards, ensuring attention stays on existential threats.

## Section 6: Governance and Escalation  

**Q12. How are communities represented in governance?**  
- TML rejects accreditation by external bodies.  
- `/governance/earth/COMMUNITY_SEAT_RULES.md` enforces **Recognition, Not Accreditation**: representatives are chosen through their own governance protocols, verified but not appointed by TML.  

**Q13. What happens in systemic attacks or governance paralysis?**  
- `/governance/earth/EMERGENCY_COUNCIL.md` defines the **Governance State of Emergency Protocol**.  
- Triggered if Ombudsperson queues overflow or >10% of communities enter conflict simultaneously.  
- A temporary council of high-reputation community representatives takes charge, filtering out malicious floods and prioritizing urgent ecological risks.  

---

## Section 7: Audits and Enforcement  

**Q14. How does this system ensure accountability in court?**  
Every Always Memory log contains:  
- Decision state (+1, 0, –1),  
- Hash of ecological ruleset version,  
- Source of data (global treaty or local oracle),  
- Digital signatures.  

This creates an immutable, verifiable chain of evidence admissible in court under fraud, environmental, and data protection laws.  

**Q15. What penalties exist for violations?**  
- Missing or falsified ecological logs create an **irrebuttable presumption of guilt**, triggering criminal penalties for operators.  
- Executives may face personal liability, including imprisonment, under fraud and environmental statutes.

## Conclusion  

The Environmental Extension of Ternary Moral Logic transforms AI accountability into planetary accountability.  

- **Sacred Zero** ensures hesitation whenever ecological harm is possible.  
- **Always Memory** guarantees every ecological decision is permanently logged.  
- **Global Baselines** bring the weight of treaties and science.  
- **Local Witnesses** give voice to Indigenous and ethnic communities.  
- **Economic Incentives** sustain vigilance and truth.  
- **Governance Protocols** ensure sovereignty and fairness.  
- **Auditability** makes every action court-admissible.  

This architecture does more than protect ecosystems. It honors the living fabric of Earth, ensuring that AI cannot act against it without leaving behind a trail of truth and accountability. In doing so, it becomes not only a system of logic but a covenant of stewardship.
