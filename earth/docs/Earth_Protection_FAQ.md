# Earth Protection FAQ  
*Ternary Moral Logic — Always Memory Extension*  

---

## Introduction  

This document explains how Ternary Moral Logic (TML), strengthened by the **Sacred Zero** and **Always Memory**, extends its accountability framework to ecological protection. The FAQ answers core questions about how ecosystems, communities, and future generations are safeguarded under TML.  

---

## Q1. What is the purpose of Earth Protection in TML?  

The purpose is to expand TML’s accountability beyond human-centered harm to include ecological harm. This ensures that AI systems must hesitate (`0`), log (`Always Memory`), and escalate decisions when risks to ecosystems, species, or planetary boundaries are detected.  

---

## Q2. Who are considered stakeholders in TML’s environmental protection framework?  

TML expands the definition of “stakeholder” beyond human-centric models. In the context of ecological protection, stakeholders include:  

1. **Human Communities** — individuals, groups, or societies directly impacted by ecological decisions, including vulnerable and Indigenous peoples.  
2. **Non-Human Entities** — species, habitats, and ecosystems recognized as having intrinsic value. These are represented through scientific proxies (e.g., IUCN Red List species, ecosystem integrity indices) or through registered community data (e.g., local ecological monitoring).  
3. **Future Generations** — represented by designated guardians, ensuring that long-term ecological impacts are considered in present-day decision-making.  

By formally embedding all three categories into **Sacred Zero** triggers and **Always Memory** logs, TML ensures that risks to ecosystems or species—whether or not immediate human harm is visible—are treated as legitimate grounds for hesitation, documentation, and accountability.  

**Legal Note:** This expansion is consistent with international legal precedents. The **Paris Agreement** and **Convention on Biological Diversity** recognize non-human and planetary interests. The constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia, and numerous court rulings worldwide, recognize the “Rights of Nature.” TML operationalizes these principles in code.

## Q3. How does TML detect ecological harm?  

TML uses a **two-tier ecological conscience**:  

* **Tier 1: Global Baseline** — mandatory datasets from official treaties, scientific bodies, and environmental regulators (e.g., IPCC, UN biodiversity reports, EPA, EU directives).  
* **Tier 2: Local Witness Layer** — data collected and cryptographically attested by Indigenous and local communities, integrated via Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs).  

Together, these tiers ensure that both systemic and localized harms can trigger Sacred Zero events.  

---

## Q4. How are Indigenous and ethnic groups protected?  

Ethnic and Indigenous groups are empowered as **data stewards** of their ecosystems:  

* They register Sovereign Ecological Records under their own governance models.  
* Data is cryptographically signed and controlled under **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** principles.  
* Communities receive Stewardship tokens and micro-grants from the **Stewardship Fund**, ensuring their monitoring efforts are rewarded.  
* In cases of verified ecological harm, Sacred Zero requires AI operators to escalate decisions to human overseers and engage directly with affected communities.  

---

## Q5. How does TML align with the right to be forgotten (GDPR)?  

TML uses **hybrid storage and cryptographic erasure**:  

* On-chain: only hashes of logs, immutable and permanent.  
* Off-chain: full logs encrypted with per-user or per-community keys.  
* When erasure is invoked, the relevant key is destroyed, rendering the data indecipherable while preserving the evidentiary trail.  

This reconciles Always Memory with privacy laws.  

---

## Q6. What prevents false or manipulated community data?  

TML employs multiple safeguards:  

* **Peer Verification Quorums** — community protocols define how many monitors must confirm a report before it is published.  
* **Threshold Cryptography** — no single Oracle or monitor can unilaterally control data entry.  
* **Sacred Zero Default** — if conflicting or suspicious data is detected, the system halts and escalates rather than making a false positive or false negative decision.  

---

## Q7. How are economic incentives structured?  

The **Stewardship Fund** ensures sustainability:  

* A percentage of network fees and penalties funds micro-grants for communities and rewards Oracle nodes.  
* Reports are valued by ecological severity (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3), incentivizing focus on the most critical threats.  
* Proof-of-Stewardship reputation strengthens trustworthy communities’ long-term influence.  

---

## Q8. How does governance remain fair and inclusive?  

TML uses a **Recognition, Not Accreditation** model:  

* Communities select their representatives through self-determined governance.  
* The Accountability Council only verifies adherence to the community’s stated governance protocol.  
* Ombudsperson Protocol and Emergency Council rules ensure fair resolution of internal conflicts or systemic attacks.  

---

## Conclusion  

With the integration of **Sacred Zero**, **Always Memory**, and Earth Protection, TML becomes the first AI accountability framework that protects not only humans but also ecosystems, species, and future generations. By mandating official datasets, empowering Indigenous communities, and embedding ecological harm into its very logic, TML delivers a Green Readiness architecture designed to withstand the legal, ethical, and technical challenges of planetary governance.  

This is not only an ethical upgrade. It is a survival architecture.
