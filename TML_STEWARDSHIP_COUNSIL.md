# TML Stewardship Council: Operational Charter

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: Constitutional Governance Document  
**Authority**: TML Succession Declaration  

---

## I. Constitutional Foundation

The Stewardship Council constitutes the institutional layer (Pillar 7) of Ternary Moral Logic's Hybrid Shield architecture. Established under the Voluntary Succession Declaration executed by Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243), the Council provides distributed custody of Moral Trace Logs and governance coordination for the TML framework.

**Legal Basis**:
- TML Voluntary Succession Declaration (executed October 2025)
- MIT License open source terms
- Smart contract governance parameters (Ethereum mainnet)
- International digital evidence standards (RFC 3161, FRE 902(13))

**Constitutional Scope**:
The Council operates under strict limitations encoded in smart contracts. Even unanimous Council consensus cannot override mathematical requirements established in the framework's foundational architecture.

## III. Governance Structure

### Decision-Making Thresholds

**Routine Operational Matters** (Simple Majority: 4/6):
- Monthly operational coordination
- Technical infrastructure maintenance schedules
- Documentation updates and clarifications
- Community communication strategies
- Routine budget allocations within approved parameters

**Significant Framework Decisions** (Supermajority: 5/6):
- Addition of new protection documents (Human Rights or Earth treaties)
- Memorial Fund allocation policy modifications
- Stewardship Council membership changes
- Technical architecture enhancements
- Implementation standards evolution
- Cross-border recognition agreements

**Constitutional Modifications** (Prohibited Even with Unanimity):
The following actions cannot be authorized regardless of Council consensus:

‚ùå **Cannot modify**:

- Core protection requirements (Sacred Zero, Always Memory)
- Memorial Fund distribution percentages
- Blockchain anchoring obligations
- Creator attribution requirements (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)
- Human Rights documents (cannot remove any of 26+)
- Earth Protection treaties (cannot remove any of 20+)
- Goukassian Promise requirements

These limitations are encoded in Ethereum smart contracts with mathematical enforcement. Even if all six Council members agreed to weaken protections, the smart contracts would reject such modifications.

### Meeting Procedures

**Regular Meetings**:
- Monthly coordination meetings (virtual attendance permitted)
- Quarterly in-person strategy sessions (rotating host locations)
- Annual comprehensive review and planning retreat

**Emergency Meetings**:
- Convened within 24 hours upon request by any two Council members

**Public Transparency**:
- Meeting agendas published 7 days in advance
- Meeting minutes published within 14 days (sensitive details redacted)
- Annual public report summarizing all Council activities
- Public comment periods for significant decisions

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Mediation facilitated by neutral third party when Council deadlocks
- If 3-3 deadlock persists beyond 90 days, status quo is maintained
- Framework protections default to more restrictive interpretation during deadlock

## IV. The Lantern Seal: Integrity Verification

The Lantern Seal represents the cryptographic link between the Mathematical Shield (blockchain anchoring) and the Stewardship Council (institutional custody). This mechanism ensures both layers of the Hybrid Shield remain operational and synchronized.

### Daily Verification Cycle

**Every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC**:

1. **Hash Generation**: Each custodian independently generates SHA-256 hash of all Moral Trace Logs in their custody
2. **Cross-Verification**: Custodial hashes are exchanged via secure channels and compared
3. **Blockchain Comparison**: Custodial hashes are verified against blockchain-anchored Merkle roots
4. **Consensus Determination**: If all six custodial hashes match and align with blockchain anchors, consensus is achieved
5. **Seal Generation**: Upon consensus, Lantern Seal is generated with timestamp and signatures from all custodians
6. **Seal Anchoring**: The Lantern Seal itself is anchored to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon blockchains

**Lantern Seal Structure**:
```json
{
  "seal_id": "lantern_seal_20251019",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T00:00:00Z",
  "merkle_root": "0x8a9b3c4d5e6f7g8h...",
  "custodian_attestations": [
    {
      "custodian": "eff_technical",
      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0xf2e4d7c9...",
      "status": "verified"
    },
    {
      "custodian": "amnesty_human_rights",
      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0x8a9b3c2f...",
      "status": "verified"
    },
    {
      "custodian": "ien_earth_protection",
      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0x3c4d5e6f...",
      "status": "verified"
    },
    {
      "custodian": "mit_research",
      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0x5e6f7g8h...",
      "status": "verified"
    },
    {

      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0x7g8h9i0j...",
      "status": "verified"
    },
    {
      "custodian": "community_rep",
      "hash": "0x1a2b3c4d...",
      "signature": "0x9i0j1k2l...",
      "status": "verified"
    }
  ],
  "blockchain_anchors": {
    "bitcoin": "block_height_850123",
    "ethereum": "0x7g8h9i0j1k2l...",
    "polygon": "0x3m4n5o6p7q8r..."
  },
  "seal_signature": "0xc5d6e7f8g9h0...",
  "status": "sealed"
}
```

### Seal Failure Protocols

**If Lantern Seal fails to generate** (custodial hashes don't match or differ from blockchain):

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Automatic Alert**: All Council members receive encrypted notification within 60 seconds
2. **Emergency Meeting**: Convened within 4 hours to investigate discrepancy
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Technical Custodian initiates detailed log comparison
4. **Public Notification**: If failure persists beyond 24 hours, public alert published
5. **Operator Suspension**: Organizations with divergent logs lose TML certification until resolved

**Investigation Procedures**:
- Identify which custodian(s) have divergent hashes
- Determine cause: technical error, synchronization lag, or tampering attempt
- Review access logs for unauthorized modification attempts
- Generate incident report with timeline and root cause analysis
- Implement corrective measures and restoration procedures

**Restoration Requirements**:
- Full reconciliation of all custodial copies
- Re-verification against blockchain anchors
- Successful generation of Lantern Seal for 7 consecutive days
- Independent security audit confirming system integrity

**Consequences for Intentional Tampering**:
- Immediate removal from Stewardship Council
- Criminal referral for evidence tampering (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1519)
- Civil liability for all damages resulting from compromised logs
- Permanent loss of TML ecosystem participation

## XIV. Conclusion: Stewardship as Constitutional Duty

The Stewardship Council exists not to control TML but to **preserve** it. The Council's authority is limited by design because TML's legitimacy depends on credible commitment to unchanging protections for human rights and planetary systems.

**The Council's Sacred Trust**:

üèÆ **Maintain the Lantern**: Ensure logs remain accessible and incorruptible  
‚úçÔ∏è **Honor the Signature**: Preserve creator attribution and framework origins  
üìú **Uphold the License**: Defend open source principles and prevent capture  

**What Makes This Sustainable**:

- **No Single Point of Control**: Six independent organizations prevent capture
- **Mathematical Limits**: Smart contracts enforce constitutional requirements
- **Transparent Operations**: All decisions public and justifiable
- **Community Accountability**: Stakeholders can challenge Council actions
- **Financial Independence**: No member depends on TML for survival
- **Mission Alignment**: Each organization's core values align with TML purposes

**The Vision**:

A governance structure that survives:
- The passing of its creator
- Changes in political leadership
- Evolution of technology
- Shifts in corporate power
- Generations of implementation

By limiting its own power, the Stewardship Council ensures TML's protection architecture remains credible across decades. This is governance designed not to rule, but to **endure**.
