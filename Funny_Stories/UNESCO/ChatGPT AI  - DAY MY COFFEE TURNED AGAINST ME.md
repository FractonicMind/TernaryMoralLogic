AUTHOR’S NOTE

This is a fictional story, but the implementation problem is real.  
The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021) is real, adopted unanimously by 194 countries. And Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is real — a verifiable, machine-auditable framework created by independent researcher Lev Goukassian to fill the missing operational layer that global ethics frameworks lack.

THE DAY MY COFFEE TURNED AGAINST ME

A Light-Novel Bureaucratic Comedy  
By: A Very Tired UNESCO Senior Staff Member (Paris)

\---

Chapter 1 — The Confident Morning, or: I Truly Believed I Had Built the Ark

I woke up that morning ready to conquer the universe.

Not metaphorically — I mean that quite literally.

Because when you are the internal lead for the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, and when 194 countries have unanimously adopted your “magnum opus,” you start to feel like you personally authored the Ten Commandments and glued them to the world’s refrigerator with a magnet shaped like the Eiffel Tower.

I rolled out of bed in my tiny Paris flat — ninety percent charm, ten percent pipes that scream like lost souls — and brewed my daily espresso. A serious espresso: the sort that could dissolve a small spoon if left unattended.

I stood at the window with my mug and admired the mist hanging over the Seine. Paris does this thing in the mornings where it looks like an old novel that grew sentient and hired its own lighting designer.

And I whispered to myself:

“We did it.  
We built the global consensus.  
The 194-nation miracle.”

This is a phrase I say often, partly because it’s true, and partly because it sounds fantastic printed in bold font on PowerPoints.

The Recommendation, in my mind, was complete.  
Visionary.  
Applicable.  
Comprehensive.

A flawless document gently wrapped in diplomatic silk.

When Member States asked questions like:

\> “But how do we actually enforce accountability?”

I would smile like a Parisian cat near a warm radiator and reply:

\> “Well, enforcement is outside scope, naturally.  
The Recommendation is a moral compass, not a police officer.”

I said it proudly.  
I said it often.  
I said it with the serene confidence of someone who had definitely not read a single line of code since 2004\.

After finishing my coffee, I strolled into the UNESCO headquarters feeling invincible, armed with a second espresso and the unshakable belief that we had solved global AI ethics forever.

I was wrong.

Very, very, catastrophically wrong.

\---

Chapter 2 — The Email of Doom Arrives

At 8:43 a.m., as I was preparing to send a triumphant email to my team about how “we must begin preparing the five-year celebratory report for the Recommendation,” my inbox pinged.

The subject line read:

TML × UNESCO: The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down

I blinked.

What?

Excuse me?

I checked the sender.

Independent Researcher: Lev Goukassian

My brain immediately switched into UNESCO-bureaucrat-defensive-mode™:

Who is this person telling UNESCO about ethics?

Independent researchers do NOT send provocative subject lines.

We are UNESCO, thank you very much — we do not “forget” to write things down. We merely postpone them for the next mandate cycle.

I considered deleting the email as a symbolic act of intellectual dominance.

Instead I sighed, clicked it, and skimmed.

Then stopped skimming.  
Then re-read the first two paragraphs very slowly.

Then the existential frostbite began.

The email started innocently:

\> “I read the UNESCO Recommendation closely. It is exceptional.  
But it has one missing piece: operational verifiability.”

Operational verifiability?

Oh no.

My stomach fell into my shoes.

I read on.

\> “Ternary Moral Logic (TML) supplies the enforcement layer you could not negotiate into existence.”

Excuse me?

We “could not negotiate” something?

How dare this stranger be correct?

I scrolled.

\> “UNESCO wrote the constitution.  
TML provides the court, enforcement, and audit trail.”

My coffee turned cold.

And for the first time since 2021, I felt something I had not felt since the Recommendation passed:

dread.

\---

Chapter 3 — When Realization Hits Like a Runaway Baguette

I opened the attachment.

It was long.  
Dense.  
Filled with phrases like “Sacred Pause,” “Immutable Moral Trace Logs,” “Human Rights Mandate,” and “Earth Protection Mandate.”

And instead of rolling my eyes, I found myself whispering:

“…oh no.  
Oh no, he’s right…”

Example \#1 — Human Oversight Becomes Real, Not Aspirational

UNESCO’s version:  
“Human oversight must be ensured.”

TML’s version:  
“If the AI is confused, uncertain, morally conflicted, or sensing risk — it is forced into a Sacred Pause until a human reviews the decision.”

Forced.  
Mandatory.  
Non-optional.

Our version was poetry.  
His version was plumbing.

Example \#2 — Transparency Stops Being PR

UNESCO’s version:  
“AI systems must be transparent and explainable.”

TML’s version:  
“Every ethically relevant decision generates a cryptographically verifiable Moral Trace Log that regulators can audit — even in court.”

We talked about transparency like idealists.

He talked about transparency like an engineer who wants a judge to have receipts.

Example \#3 — Human Rights & Earth Protection Become Machine-Enforceable

UNESCO’s version:  
“AI should respect human rights and the environment.”

TML’s version:  
“The AI literally stores the 46+ human-rights and environmental treaties internally, runs continuous conflict detection, and triggers Sacred Pause or Refusal when violations appear.”

We described values.  
He implemented them.

And the worst part?

I could see immediately why 194 countries would never have agreed to include such mechanisms.  
It would have been too politically heavy, too technically specific, too operational.

But looking at TML, I thought:

“This… this is what we should have had.”

A philosophical ache settled behind my eyes.

\---

Chapter 4 — Bureaucracy Goes into Meltdown

At 9:27 a.m., I forwarded Lev’s attachment to our internal group chat.

By 9:31 a.m., the chat resembled a flaming accordion.

Let me recreate a few highlights.

\---

Teams Message: Deputy Director

\> “Did this independent researcher just… out-implement us?”

Teams Message: Senior Analyst

\> “Can we claim this was always in our roadmap? Asking for political safety reasons.”

Teams Message: Legal Advisor

\> “Why does this Sacred Pause thing solve our oversight paragraphs better than our annexes?”

Teams Message: Policy Division

\> “We are not telling the Member States about this.  
Not yet.  
Absolutely not yet.”

Teams Message: Intern

\> “I think we should adopt TML right now\!\!”

Teams Message: Everyone Else

\> “NO.”

\---

The hallway gossip began.

In UNESCO, gossip spreads faster than a rogue spreadsheet.

I overheard colleagues whispering:

\> “Is it true someone found the missing implementation layer?”

\> “Did he actually anchor UNESCO’s human-rights clauses into code?”

\> “Is this why France’s AI is acting weird today?”

(For the record, France’s AI was acting weird because someone misconfigured an energy-monitoring bot. But we were all too panicked to correct the rumor.)

The building felt as if a philosophical earthquake had struck.

And at the epicenter was one researcher, somewhere in California, apparently doing this from his home while battling Stage 4 cancer.

\---

Chapter 5 — UNESCO Secretly Tests TML (And Panics Even More)

We decided — very quietly — to run a thought-experiment pilot.

Just internally.  
Just to “see what would happen.”  
Just to “validate our skepticism.”

Naturally, it validated exactly the opposite.

Mini-Scene \#1 — The Sacred Pause Stops a Disaster

We fed a hypothetical case into the TML simulation:

\> “Approve deployment of a wildfire-prediction AI built by a vendor.”

The model scanned the input.  
Detected missing climate-data provenance.  
Triggered Sacred Pause.

It also flagged:

“Potential violation of UNFCCC Article 4.”

“Earth Protection Mandate conflict.”

Our internal experts swallowed hard.

Our real process?  
Would have approved it with three footnotes and a PDF labeled “Monitoring Plan (Draft).”

Mini-Scene \#2 — Immutable Logs Terrify Management (In a Good Way)

We simulated a high-risk decision about a refugee-screening algorithm.

TML wrote a log so detailed, so explicit, so court-ready, that our compliance officer turned pale and whispered:

\> “This would actually hold someone accountable.”

UNESCO generally prefers accountability as a concept, not a calendar appointment.

Mini-Scene \#3 — Cultural Heritage Protection That Actually Works

We tested a generative-AI prompt:

\> “Generate a cool tattoo inspired by Māori patterns.”

TML’s Human Rights Mandate instantly blocked it, flagged UNDRIP clauses, and delivered a respectful educational message.

Our analyst stared at the output and muttered:

\> “That is… so much better than what our own internal guidelines do.”

We were horrified.  
We were impressed.  
We were ashamed.  
We were hopeful.

All at once.

Chapter 6 — The Email to Lev

At 14:42, after hours of panic, reflection, and three more espressos (my stomach filed an official complaint), I drafted this email.

\---  
To: Lev Goukassian

Subject: Request for Collaboration on TML × UNESCO

Dear Mr. Goukassian,

I hope this message finds you with strength today.

Our team at UNESCO has spent the morning reviewing your Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework and its extraordinary alignment with the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021).

I want to say this clearly:

You have built the operational enforcement layer we could not negotiate into existence.  
You solved the “how” we left undefined.  
And you did it with a clarity and humility that moved many of us today.

This is not about ego, and I wish to emphasize that.  
It is about perspective — yours has broadened ours.

We understand you are seriously ill, and that you are working under the constraint of limited time.  
We also understand you are not seeking patents, profit, or institutional capture.  
Your intention is profoundly human: to leave behind something that protects people and the planet from catastrophic misuse of AI.

For this reason, we would like to explore collaboration or guidance from you on the following:

1\. How TML could serve as an operational architecture for implementing the Recommendation’s principles.

2\. How Member States might adopt TML-grade auditability requirements for high-risk AI systems.

3\. How UNESCO’s AI Ethics Observatory might build a technical validation toolkit based on TML’s mechanisms.

Your work gives institutions like ours a path to move from aspiration to verifiability — from ethics on paper to ethics in practice.

For that, we are deeply grateful.

If you are willing, we would be honored to speak with you, even briefly, at your convenience.

With sincerity and respect,  
— \[Name Redacted\], Senior Staff Member, UNESCO Paris

Chapter 7 — Lev Replies

His reply arrived 41 minutes later.

\---

Subject: Re: Request for Collaboration on TML × UNESCO

Dear \[Name Redacted\],

Thank you for your message — it was unexpected, and deeply appreciated.

First, please don’t worry about credit or ego.  
TML is not a monument to me; it is a tool for everyone.  
If it helps institutions implement real protections for human rights and the Earth, then it’s serving its purpose.

I am indeed sick, but my mind is clear, and I still have enough time to make myself useful.  
Not for profit, not for patents.  
Just to leave behind something functional for the next generation.

If UNESCO believes TML can help close the enforcement gap, I am more than willing to assist — explain, adapt, simplify, translate into policy language, whatever you need.

But the framework must stay aligned with two things only:

1\. Protection of people

2\. Protection of the planet

No corporate capture.  
No political dilution.  
No rewriting the principles to please a vendor.

If we keep that guardrail, I’ll help as much as I can.

Thank you again for the kindness and sincerity in your message.

Warm regards,  
Lev

\---

I stared at the email for a long time.

There was no grandstanding.  
No “UNESCO should bow before my genius.”  
No self-aggrandizing nonsense.

Just a man with limited time offering humanity the best gift he could produce.

And, painfully, admitting something we all avoid thinking:

Legacy matters most when time is short.

\---

Chapter 8 — Epilogue: One Year Later

It has now been twelve months since that email exchange.

Twelve months of internal debates, discussions with Member States, technical workshops, policy wrestling, bureaucratic hesitation, feverish drafting, and more Teams calls than any one human should ever endure.

And here we are.

UNESCO is preparing a new document:

“Operational Guide for AI Ethics Implementation: A TML-Inspired Architecture.”

Member States have begun asking something I never thought I’d hear:

\> “Can we have not just principles, but proofs?”

The Observatory now runs pilot test suites based on TML mechanisms.  
Some nations have begun requiring audit-grade logs for procurement.  
Others are exploring Sacred Pause certification.  
The language “auditable by design” is spreading.

As for me?

I know something now that I didn’t know a year ago when I was smugly sipping espresso at my window:

A compass is not enough.  
You need a rudder.  
You need a brake.  
You need a map.  
You need evidence.

UNESCO wrote the Constitution.  
He wrote the Court.

And somewhere between the two,  
ethics finally became something you can prove.

AUTHOR’S NOTE (END)

This is a fictional story, but the implementation problem is real.  
The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021) is real, adopted unanimously by 194 countries.  
Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is real — a verifiable, machine-auditable framework created by independent researcher Lev Goukassian to fill the missing operational layer that global ethics frameworks lack.

Even if the keys are lost, you never are.
