## The Guardian Value Proposition - What Institutions Actually Want

### **Exclusive Research Access**

**The Dataset Opportunity**:
```yaml
research_access:
  scale: "Millions of real-world AI decisions across industries"
  diversity: "Hiring, lending, healthcare, content moderation, criminal justice"
  bias_patterns: "Real discrimination attempts and algorithmic bias detection"
  effectiveness: "Before/after comparison of AI governance interventions"
  
unique_attributes:
