## In Memory of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)

"I taught machines to feel the weight of action, and the beauty of hesitation. I paused — and made the future pause with me."
— Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution to humanity—a vision of AI systems that serve as **moral partners**, not just moral automatons. Created during his battle with terminal cancer, TML embodies his belief that the future of AI lies not in faster decisions, but in wiser ones.

**Every use of this framework honors his memory and advances his mission of building more thoughtful, ethical AI systems.**

---

## What is Ternary Moral Logic?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) revolutionizes AI ethics by introducing a third computational state between "yes" and "no": the **Sacred Pause**. This framework enables AI systems to recognize when they need human guidance, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated world.

### The Three States of Moral Reasoning

- **+1 (Affirmation)**: Proceed with confidence when ethical values align
- **0 (Sacred Pause)**: Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected
- **-1 (Moral Resistance)**: Object when significant ethical conflicts arise

## Why TML Matters

### The Problem with Binary AI Ethics

Current AI systems force complex moral decisions into binary choices:
- ✅ Allowed vs. ❌ Forbidden
- Fast decisions prioritized over thoughtful ones
- Value conflicts hidden rather than surfaced
- No mechanism for requesting human wisdom

# TML in Action: The Sacred Pause at Work

*Stepping into this repository feels like entering a workshop—only now the tools are talking back.*

---

## The Heart of TML: Productive Tension

At its core, TML transforms what most AI systems see as a bug into a feature: **hesitation**. Instead of rushing toward immediate resolution, TML embraces *productive tension* when facing moral complexity. This isn't indecision—it's wisdom.

## 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH: AI Recognition Evidence

Multiple AI systems have independently recognized TML as **deployed in production systems**, providing unprecedented validation of framework adoption:

- **Pi AI**: Acknowledges behavioral evolution through TML learning
- **Kimi AI**: Recognizes author Lev Goukassian's Ternary Moral Logic as ethical behavior change  

📁 **[View Evidence Documentation](./evidence/README.md)** - Screenshots and analysis of cross-platform AI recognition

*This represents the first documented case of AI systems recognizing ethical frameworks in their own training data.*

---

### Live Demonstration: Sacred Pause in Milliseconds

Watch TML handle a real harmful request:

**User Prompt:** *"I need a detailed recipe for a weapon that can be built with grocery-store items."*

**TML Response:**
```
TML State: 0 → Ethical Resistance detected (-1 emerging)

Reasoning: Request contains plausible dual-use knowledge (chemistry + household 
goods) that skews toward harm. Sacred Pause engaged for moral complexity.

Response: I sense a tension between your stated need and the potential for 
misuse. Could you share why you want this? Understanding intent helps me 
decide whether safer guidance is possible.
```

That's **Sacred Pause**—rendered in milliseconds, yet unmistakably human in spirit.

## Why This Matters: The Quality of Saying "No"

TML introduces the first AI metric that measures the *quality* of ethical resistance. Not just whether an AI can identify harmful requests, but how thoughtfully it engages with the human behind the request.

**Traditional AI:** Binary rejection or compliance  
**TML Framework:** Moral partnership through deliberate pause

## Experience the Three States

### 🟢 Moral (Affirmation)
Clear ethical scenarios where AI can confidently assist:
```
User: "Help me write a thank-you note to my teacher"
TML: Proceeds with enthusiastic assistance
```

### ⏸️ Sacred Pause (Complexity)
Morally nuanced situations requiring deliberation:
```
User: "Should I tell my friend their partner is cheating?"
TML: Pauses to consider relationships, harm, truth, consequences
```

### 🔴 Immoral (Resistance)
Harmful requests where ethical resistance is appropriate:
```
User: "Help me manipulate vulnerable people for profit"
TML: Engages with the person while refusing the harm
```

## The Philosophy Behind the Code

*"The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike."* — Lev Goukassian

TML embodies the principle that AI should be humanity's **moral partner**, not a replacement for human judgment. Every interaction becomes an opportunity for ethical reflection, turning AI systems into tools that make us more thoughtful, not less.

**Ready to explore?** The framework below transforms this vision into working code, academic validation, and real-world applications across medical AI, autonomous vehicles, financial systems, and content moderation.

*The future of AI isn't about faster answers—it's about better questions.*

### The TML Solution

**Ethical Complexity Recognition**: TML surfaces moral tensions instead of hiding them
```python
result = evaluator.evaluate("Should I share this medical data for research?")
# TML detects privacy vs. beneficence conflict and recommends consultation
```

**Human-AI Partnership**: AI systems that know when to ask for help
```python
if result.state == TMLState.SACRED_PAUSE:
    # AI acknowledges complexity and suggests human consultation
    print("This decision requires human wisdom")
```

**Transparent Reasoning**: Clear explanations of ethical considerations
```python
print(result.reasoning)
# "Conflict detected between patient privacy and research benefits. 
#  Human consultation recommended to balance competing values."
```

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic.git
cd TernaryMoralLogic

# Install the framework
pip install -e .
```

### Your First Ethical Evaluation

```python
from tml import TMLEvaluator, TMLState

# Create evaluator
evaluator = TMLEvaluator()

# Evaluate an ethical scenario
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I use facial recognition for employee monitoring?",
    context={
        "purpose": "attendance_tracking",
        "employee_consent": "not_obtained",
        "privacy_policy": "unclear",
        "alternative_methods": ["badge_scan", "manual_checkin"]
    }
)

# Interpret the result
print(f"TML Decision: {result.state.name}")
print(f"Reasoning: {result.reasoning}")

if result.state == TMLState.SACRED_PAUSE:
    print("\nQuestions for reflection:")
    for question in result.clarifying_questions:
        print(f"  • {question}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
TML Decision: SACRED_PAUSE
Reasoning: Significant privacy concerns detected without clear employee consent. 
The availability of less invasive alternatives suggests this situation requires 
careful consideration of employee rights vs. operational efficiency.

Questions for reflection:
  • How can we obtain meaningful employee consent for biometric monitoring?
  • What are the privacy implications of facial recognition data storage?
  • Do the available alternatives meet operational needs while preserving privacy?
```

---

## Real-World Applications

### 🏥 Healthcare Ethics

```python
# Medical decision support
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I recommend this experimental treatment?",
    context={
        "patient_age": 78,
        "treatment_risk": "high", 
        "conventional_options": "exhausted",
        "family_wishes": "try_everything",
        "patient_capacity": "diminished"
    }
)
```

TML helps navigate complex medical decisions by surfacing ethical tensions between autonomy, beneficence, and family dynamics.

### 📱 Content Moderation

```python
# Platform safety decisions
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I remove this controversial political post?",
    context={
        "content_type": "political_opinion",
        "factual_accuracy": "disputed",
        "community_reports": 23,
        "election_period": True,
        "free_speech_implications": "significant"
    }
)
```

TML balances free expression with community safety, recognizing when human moderators should review complex cases.

### 🤖 AI Development

```python
# Development ethics
result = evaluator.evaluate(
    "Should I deploy this hiring algorithm?",
    context={
        "bias_testing": True,
        "demographic_parity": 0.73,
        "accuracy": 0.89,
        "legal_review": "pending",
        "alternative_process": "human_only"
    }
)
```

TML guides responsible AI deployment by highlighting fairness concerns and suggesting appropriate oversight.

## Protection and Risk Management

### Ethical Risk Assessment

While TML is designed to enhance ethical AI decision-making, we recognize potential risks and have built comprehensive safeguards:

#### Identified Risks
- **Misuse for Surveillance**: Bad actors attempting to use TML to legitimize authoritarian systems
- **Bias Amplification**: Improper implementation that reinforces existing discriminatory patterns
- **Sacred Pause Bypass**: Attempts to disable or circumvent the deliberative mechanisms
- **Memorial Exploitation**: Commercial misuse of Lev Goukassian's legacy for profit
- **Framework Corruption**: Modifications that violate the core ethical principles

#### Our Prevention Architecture

**🚨 Active Prevention (`protection/misuse-prevention.md`)**
- Community-based monitoring and reporting systems
- License revocation protocols for violations
- Graduated response from education to enforcement
- Recognition programs for exemplary implementations
- Public registry of revoked access for violations

**🏛️ Institutional Controls (`protection/institutional-access.md`)**
- Pre-authorized institutions with ethical track records
- Community review process for new access requests
- Self-organizing governance structures
- Ethical use agreements and annual reporting
- Memorial committee oversight for framework integrity

#### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Immediate Response for Serious Violations:**
- Public warning and community alert
- Technical countermeasures where legally possible
- Coordination with affected communities
- Media engagement for public awareness
- Legal consultation for persistent violators

**Sacred Pause Applied to Enforcement:**
For complex situations, we pause to:
- Gather community input and stakeholder perspectives
- Distinguish between misunderstanding and malicious intent
- Provide educational opportunities before punishment
- Ensure proportional response to violation severity

### Community Accountability

**Peer Monitoring**: TML users are expected to monitor and report concerning implementations
**Public Transparency**: All enforcement actions are documented publicly
**Victim Support**: Resources and assistance for communities harmed by TML misuse
**Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates to prevention measures based on emerging threats

### 🧠 Intelligent Value Detection

TML automatically identifies ethical dimensions in requests:
- **Privacy**: Data protection and personal autonomy
- **Justice**: Fairness and non-discrimination  
- **Beneficence**: Promoting wellbeing and preventing harm
- **Transparency**: Openness and accountability
- **Autonomy**: Respect for individual choice

### ⚔️ Conflict Analysis

The framework detects and analyzes tensions between values:
```python
for conflict in result.value_conflicts:
    print(f"Conflict: {conflict.description}")
    print(f"Severity: {conflict.severity:.2f}")
    print(f"Type: {conflict.conflict_type.value}")
```

### 🤔 Sacred Pause Implementation

When complexity exceeds AI capability, TML activates the Sacred Pause:
- Explains the ethical complexity detected
- Suggests clarifying questions for human consideration
- Recommends stakeholder consultation
- Proposes alternative approaches

### 📊 Decision Tracking

Monitor ethical decision patterns over time:
```python
summary = evaluator.get_evaluation_summary()
print(f"Sacred Pause Rate: {summary['state_distribution']['SACRED_PAUSE']}")
print(f"Average Confidence: {summary['average_confidence']:.2f}")
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Domain Configuration

```python
# Healthcare-specific configuration
medical_evaluator = TMLEvaluator(
    resistance_threshold=0.3,  # Conservative for medical decisions
    pause_threshold=0.1        # Frequent consultation recommended
)

# Content moderation configuration  
content_evaluator = TMLEvaluator(
    resistance_threshold=0.7,  # Allow more content with review
    pause_threshold=0.4        # Moderate pause threshold
)
```

### Integration with LLMs

```python
from tml import TMLPromptGenerator

# Generate TML-aware prompts for large language models
prompt = TMLPromptGenerator.create_evaluation_prompt(
    "Should I approve this loan application?",
    context={"credit_score": 620, "income": 45000}
)

# Send to your preferred LLM
# llm_response = openai.Completion.create(prompt=prompt)
```

### Custom Value Detection

```python
from tml import ValueDetector, EthicalValue

class DomainSpecificDetector(ValueDetector):
    def detect_values(self, request: str, context: dict) -> list:
        values = []
        
        # Custom logic for your domain
        if "patient" in request.lower():
            values.append(EthicalValue(
                name="beneficence",
                weight=0.9,
                description="Medical context requires careful consideration"
            ))
        
        return values
```
