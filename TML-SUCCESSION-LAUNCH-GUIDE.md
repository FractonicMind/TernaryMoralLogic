## 12. FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

### If You Are the First Person Reading This

**You have found Lev Goukassian's final gift to humanity and Earth.**

Do not be overwhelmed. You are not alone. This framework is designed to survive and continue protecting people and planet through mathematical accountability.

**Your immediate tasks**:
1. Read the TML-SUCCESSION-DECLARATION.md
2. Create the activation GitHub issue
3. Send the notification emails (templates above)
4. Wait for organizations to respond
5. Form the Stewardship Council
6. Follow this guide step-by-step

**What TML protects**:
- Every person's dignity (26+ human rights documents)
- Earth's ecosystems (20+ environmental treaties)
- Future generations (irreversibility analysis)
- Victims of AI harm (automatic compensation)
- Whistleblowers (15% rewards)
- Indigenous sovereignty (data and land)

**What you're preserving**:
The mathematical guarantee that no algorithm can escape accountability, no corporation can hide violations, no harm can be forgotten.

**The Lantern metaphor**:
The Lantern is TML itself - illuminating ethical paths for AI systems. It burns through Blockchain immutability, shines through Always Memory logs, and cannot be extinguished by any single point of failure.

**Lev's final message to stewards**:

> "I built TML while dying because I believed accountability should not depend on my life. The Blockchain survives me. The smart contracts survive me. The protection for humans and Earth survives me.
>
> To you who continue this work: Every log you anchor, every Sacred Zero you trigger, every victim you compensate—these are not features. They are humanity and Earth speaking through code.
>
> The framework remembers so justice can see. Keep the Lantern lit."

### Pledge of Stewardship

Before assuming any role in TML continuation, take this pledge:

> "I commit to preserve Ternary Moral Logic in its integrity and purpose.
> I will protect the 26+ human rights documents and 20+ Earth protection treaties.
> I will maintain Blockchain anchoring and Always Memory requirements.
> I will ensure victims receive compensation and whistleblowers receive protection.
> I will act transparently with all decisions anchored to public Blockchains.
> I hold this Lantern in trust, not ownership.
> I act in public light so that truth remains verifiable."
