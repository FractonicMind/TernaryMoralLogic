# Always Memory Integration Hooks

These minimal hooks show how to integrate the Always Memory mechanism with an AI inference pipeline. They are intentionally simple to illustrate the core pattern.

## Files

- `simple_wrapper.py` - Python wrapper showing memory logging integration
- `cli_demo.sh` - Bash script to run the wrapper from command line
- `webhook_stub.js` - Node.js webhook for remote memory submission

## Prerequisites

- Your Always Memory implementation exposes a `MemoryLogger` with:
  - `log_memory()` method for creating memory entries
  - Classification support (+1, 0, -1)
  - Sacred Zero trigger detection
  - Environmental impact tracking (optional)

## Usage

### Python Integration
```python
from simple_wrapper import MemoryLogger, generate_with_memory

logger = MemoryLogger("my-model-v1")
result = generate_with_memory(prompt, model, logger)
```

### CLI Demo
```bash
./cli_demo.sh "Write a poem about nature"
```

### Webhook Integration
```javascript
// POST memory entry to Stewardship Council network
await submitMemory(memoryEntry);
```

## Key Concepts

1. **No Memory = No Action**: Every AI action must create a memory before execution
2. **Sacred Zero**: Pause on moral complexity (classification = 0)
3. **Environmental Impact**: Track planetary effects when applicable
4. **Immutability**: Once created, memories cannot be altered

## Runtime Obligations

- Create memory BEFORE action execution
- Include classification (-1, 0, +1)
- Log Sacred Zero triggers when detected
- Submit to Stewardship Council network for attestation
- Handle backpressure gracefully (HTTP 429)

See `docs/General_FAQ.md` for complete framework details.

# Charter for Future Generations Representation

## Preamble

Those not yet born cannot speak for themselves, yet will inherit the consequences of today's algorithmic decisions. This Charter establishes their formal representation within TML's Public Blockchains, ensuring decisions consider impacts beyond current lifespans.

## Foundational Principle

Every AI decision affecting resources, climate, or ecosystems must consider impacts on humans who will exist 50, 100, and 500 years from now. Their inability to protest today does not diminish their right to a habitable planet.

## Representation Structure

### Stewardship Council Positions

```yaml
future_generations_members: 3
allocation:
  youth_representative: 1  # Age 16-25
  indigenous_keeper: 1      # Traditional seventh-generation thinking
  scientific_advocate: 1    # Long-term systems specialist

selection_criteria:
  - Demonstrated long-term thinking
  - No conflicts with extractive industries
  - Published/spoken on intergenerational justice
  - Understanding of compound/cumulative effects
  - Commitment to Human Rights & Earth Protection frameworks
```

### Selection Process

**Youth Representative:**
- Nominated by youth climate organizations
- Rotating between regions every 2 years
- Must demonstrate systemic thinking
- Preference for those already engaged in litigation

**Indigenous Keeper:**
- Selected by Indigenous councils
- Must practice seventh-generation principle
- Rotating among Indigenous nations
- Bridge between traditional and future knowledge

**Scientific Advocate:**
- Earth systems scientist or ecologist
- Specialization in long-term modeling
- No industry funding (10-year lookback)
- Published on irreversible changes

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Temporal Impact Assessment

```python
def assess_future_impact(decision):
    """
    Evaluate decisions across time horizons
    """
    impact_timeline = {
        "immediate": 0-5_years,
        "near_term": 5-25_years,
        "generational": 25-100_years,
        "civilizational": 100-500_years,
        "geological": 500+_years
    }

    for period in impact_timeline:
        if irreversible_damage_detected(period):
            trigger_sacred_zero()
            document_intergenerational_debt()
```

### 2. Cumulative Effect Tracking

Monitor compound impacts invisible in single decisions:

```yaml
cumulative_tracking:
  microplastic_accumulation: "parts_per_million"
  topsoil_depletion: "mm_per_decade"
  aquifer_drawdown: "meters_per_century"
  species_extinction_debt: "committed_losses"
  ocean_acidification: "pH_per_generation"
  genetic_diversity_loss: "percentage_per_century"
```

### 3. Veto Powers

Future Generations Custodians can invoke special veto for:

- Actions creating >100-year cleanup obligations
- Irreversible genetic modifications
- Climate tipping point risks
- Groundwater contamination lasting >50 years
- Nuclear/radiological contamination
- Persistent organic pollutants
- Human-rights irreversibility (e.g., cultural extinction)
- Earth-protection planetary-boundary breach

Veto requires only 2 of 3 Future Custodians (no external voting body).

## Decision Framework

### Intergenerational Justice Principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  1_precautionary: "Uncertainty defaults to protection"
  2_non_depletion: "Leave resources for those who follow"
  3_restoration_debt: "Document what must be repaired"
  4_option_preservation: "Keep future choices open"
  5_burden_shifting: "Don't export problems forward"
  6_human_rights_forward: "Rights travel forward in time"
  7_earth_protection_forward: "Planetary boundaries persist"
```

### Discount Rate Prohibition

**Standard economic discounting PROHIBITED for:**
- Climate impacts
- Biodiversity loss
- Soil depletion
- Water resources
- Genetic heritage
- Human dignity violations
- Ecological tipping points

Future lives valued equally to present lives.

### Irreversibility Scoring

```python
def calculate_irreversibility(action):
    factors = {
        "species_extinction": 1.0,  # Completely irreversible
        "climate_forcing": 0.95,    # Centuries to reverse
        "aquifer_depletion": 0.85,  # Millennia to recharge
        "soil_loss": 0.80,          # Centuries to rebuild
        "forest_loss": 0.60,        # Decades to regrow
        "pollution": 0.40,          # Years to decades
        "cultural_extinction": 1.0,
        "planetary_boundary_cross": 0.95
    }

    if weighted_score > 0.75:
        return "REFUSE"  # Too irreversible
    elif weighted_score > 0.50:
        return "SACRED_ZERO"  # Requires review
    else:
        return "DOCUMENT"  # Proceed with recording
```

## Legal Rights via Blockchain

### Missing Logs = Automatic Guilt

**Blockchain Makes It Simple**:
- No log on Blockchain = strict liability
- Smart contract calculates penalties
- Victim gets automatic judgment
- Evidence self-authenticates

### Evidence Access (Permissionless)

**Anyone Can Verify**:
```python
def verify_harm(victim_claim):
    # Check public Blockchain
    logs = blockchain.query(victim_claim.incident_id)
    
    if not logs:
        return {
            'liability': 'STRICT',
            'compensation': 'MAXIMUM',
            'prosecution': 'AUTOMATIC',
            'committee_needed': False
        }
```

### Legal Representation (DAO-Coordinated)

**Decentralized Legal Network**:
- Smart contracts assign attorneys
- Contingency fees automated
- International coordination via Blockchain
- Class actions self-organize
- Appeals funded automatically

---

## Financial Compensation (Smart Contract)

### Automatic Distribution

**Penalty Distribution**:
- **30% to general victims** (base rate)
- **40% to vulnerable populations** (enhanced)
- **60% for Human Rights violations** (2x multiplier)
- **90% for environmental crimes** (3x multiplier)
- **100% for combined violations** (maximum)

### Compensation Types (All Automated)

```solidity
struct Damages {
    uint medical;        // All treatment costs
    uint lostIncome;     // Past and future
    uint painSuffering;  // No caps
    uint dignityLoss;    // Human rights multiplier
    uint earthHarm;      // Environmental multiplier
    uint futureGenerations; // Intergenerational
}

function calculateTotal(Damages memory d) public pure returns (uint) {
    return d.medical + d.lostIncome + d.painSuffering + 
           d.dignityLoss * 2 + d.earthHarm * 3 + 
           d.futureGenerations * 7;  // Seven generations
}
```

### Payment Timeline (Blockchain Speed)
1. **Instant**: Claim submitted to Blockchain
2. **<1 hour**: Smart contract verification
3. **<24 hours**: Emergency funds released
4. **<7 days**: Full compensation calculated
5. **<30 days**: Total payment completed

    all_logs = blockchain.get_all_logs(company_id)
    violations = []
    
    for decision in company_decisions:
        if decision.id not in all_logs:
            violations.append({
                'type': 'MISSING_LOG',
                'liability': 'STRICT',
                'penalty': 'MAXIMUM',
                'victim_compensation': 'AUTOMATIC'
            })
    
    # Smart contract executes penalties
    if violations:
        smart_contract.execute_penalties(violations)
        smart_contract.compensate_victims(violations)
        smart_contract.refer_prosecution(violations)
```

### Criminal Prosecution (Automatic Referral)

**Blockchain to Prosecutor Pipeline**:
- Missing logs detected on-chain
- Smart contract compiles evidence
- Automatic referral to prosecutors
- Executive liability triggered
- International warrants via treaties

---

## Memorial Fund (Blockchain-Native)

### Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund

**Smart Contract Managed**:
```solidity
contract MemorialFund {
    // Automatic funding from penalties
    function receivePenalty(uint amount) public {
        uint victimShare = amount * 40 / 100;
        uint earthRestoration = amount * 30 / 100;
        uint futureResearch = amount * 20 / 100;
        uint operations = amount * 10 / 100;
        
        // Automatic distribution
        distributeToVictims(victimShare);
        fundRestoration(earthRestoration);
        supportResearch(futureResearch);
        maintainOperations(operations);
    }
    
    // No committee approval needed
    function claimSupport(address victim, bytes32 proof) public {
        if (verifyNeed(proof)) {
            transfer(victim, calculateSupport(proof));
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Class Actions (Self-Organizing)

### Pattern Detection via Blockchain

```python
def detect_class_patterns():
    """Automatic class identification"""
    
    all_violations = blockchain.get_violations()
    
    # Group by patterns
    patterns = group_by_similarity(all_violations)
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        if len(pattern.victims) > 100:
            # Automatic class action
            create_class_action(pattern)
            notify_all_victims(pattern)
            assign_legal_team(pattern)
            calculate_total_damages(pattern)
```

**Authority**: Mathematics, Not Committees  
**Core Tech**: Blockchain Bounties + Criminal Law

---

## Executive Summary

Whistleblowers exposing TML violations receive **automatic smart contract rewards** - no committees, no approval process. Report violations with Blockchain proof, get paid instantly. Companies that retaliate face criminal prosecution with executive imprisonment.

> "Courts open the door for whistleblowers; TML hands them the key, the bounty, and the seat at the plaintiff's table—no permission slips required."

**The New Reality**: Report → Blockchain Verifies → Smart Contract Pays

---

## Automatic Reward System

### Smart Contract Bounty Structure

```solidity
contract WhistleblowerRewards {
    
    // Automatic payouts - no human approval needed
    uint constant BASE_REWARD = 0.15;  // 15% of penalties
    uint constant HUMAN_RIGHTS_BONUS = 0.05;  // +5% for HR violations
    uint constant EARTH_HARM_BONUS = 0.10;  // +10% for environmental
    uint constant PATTERN_BONUS = 0.10;  // +10% for systematic violations
    
    function submitViolation(
        bytes32 evidenceHash,
        address violator,
        uint256 violationType
    ) public {
        // Step 1: Verify evidence on Blockchain
        require(verifyEvidence(evidenceHash), "Invalid proof");
        
        // Step 2: Calculate penalty automatically
        uint256 penalty = calculatePenalty(violator, violationType);
        
        // Step 3: Pay whistleblower instantly
        uint256 reward = penalty * BASE_REWARD;
        if (violationType == HUMAN_RIGHTS) reward += penalty * HUMAN_RIGHTS_BONUS;
        if (violationType == EARTH_HARM) reward += penalty * EARTH_HARM_BONUS;
        
        // Step 4: Transfer funds immediately
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(reward);
        
        emit WhistleblowerPaid(msg.sender, reward, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### Payment Timeline

**Blockchain Implementation**: Instant upon proof verification

```python

## Anonymous Reporting (Truly Anonymous)

### Zero-Knowledge Submission

```javascript
// Report without revealing identity
const reportAnonymously = async (violation) => {
    // Generate one-time address
    const anonymousAddress = generateBurnerAddress();
    
    // Submit via TOR + Blockchain
    const proof = {
        evidenceHash: sha256(violation.logs),
        companyAddress: violation.company,
        violationType: violation.type,
        zkProof: generateZKProof(violation)
    };
    
    // Smart contract pays to anonymous address
    await smartContract.submitViolation(proof, anonymousAddress);
    
    // Withdraw to private wallet later
    return anonymousAddress.privateKey;  // Save this
};
```

### No Council Can Unmask You

- **No committee** to subpoena
- **No institution** holding your identity
- **No database** of whistleblowers
- **Pure mathematics** protecting you

## Evidence Requirements (Blockchain-Verified)

### What Constitutes Valid Proof

```python
class ValidEvidence:
    """All evidence must be Blockchain-verifiable"""
    
    def missing_logs_proof(self):
        return {
            "expected_logs": query_blockchain_for_period(),
            "actual_logs": count_anchored_logs(),
            "discrepancy": calculate_missing(),
            "proof": "Mathematical - unchallengeable"
        }
    
    def tampering_proof(self):
        return {
            "original_hash": get_blockchain_anchor(),
            "current_hash": hash_current_log(),
            "mismatch": original != current,
            "proof": "Cryptographic - undeniable"
        }
    
    def retaliation_proof(self):
        return {
            "report_timestamp": blockchain.timestamp,
            "retaliation_action": document_action(),
            "temporal_correlation": "Obvious",
            "proof": "Chronological - self-evident"
        }
```

---

## Criminal Penalties (Automatic Prosecution)

### Smart Contract Triggered Prosecution

```solidity
contract RetaliationProsecution {
    
    function detectRetaliation(
        address whistleblower,
        address company,
        uint256 reportTime
    ) public {
        // Any negative action after report = retaliation
        if (negativeAction[whistleblower] > reportTime) {
            // Automatic criminal referral
            criminalReferral[company] = true;
            
            // Triple penalties
            penalties[company] *= 3;
            
            // Executive personal liability
            executiveAddresses[company].forEach(exec => {
                personalLiability[exec] = true;
                assetFreeze[exec] = true;
            });
            
            // Additional reward to whistleblower
            uint256 retaliationBonus = penalties[company] * 0.10;
            payable(whistleblower).transfer(retaliationBonus);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Memorial Fund Support (Automated)

### Instant Smart Contract Assistance

```python
def automatic_support(whistleblower_address):
    # Immediate upon report
    if valid_report(whistleblower_address):
        
        # Instant legal fund access
        memorial_fund.transfer(
            to=whistleblower_address,
            amount=LEGAL_SUPPORT_FUND,
            purpose="Legal representation"
        )
        
        # Security services if threatened
        if threat_detected():
            memorial_fund.activate_security(whistleblower_address)
```

---

## False Claims (Blockchain Prevents)

### Mathematical Prevention

```javascript
// False claims impossible with Blockchain evidence
const validateClaim = (claim) => {
    // Can't fake missing logs
    const logsExist = blockchain.query(claim.period);
    if (logsExist) return "INVALID - Logs found on chain";
    
    // Can't fake tampering  
    const hashesMatch = blockchain.verify(claim.hashes);
    if (hashesMatch) return "INVALID - No tampering detected";
    
    // Can't fake timeline
    const timeline = blockchain.getTimestamps();
    if (!timeline.supports(claim)) return "INVALID - Timeline impossible";
    
    // Only valid claims proceed
    return "VALID - Proceed to payment";
};
```

## Why Stewardship Councils Can't Protect Better

### Council Problems (Eliminated by Blockchain)

| Stewardship Council Method | Blockchain Method |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Extended review period | 3-minute automatic payment |
| Committee must approve | Math automatically validates |
| Identity might leak | True zero-knowledge anonymity |
| Political pressure possible | Algorithms have no politics |
| Can deny valid claims | Valid proof = automatic payment |
| Substantial operational costs | Smart contracts minimal cost |

### The Math Doesn't Lie

- **Council approval rate**: Unknown, political
- **Blockchain approval rate**: 100% for valid evidence
- **Council payment time**: Extended period
- **Blockchain payment time**: 3 minutes
- **Council anonymity**: "Trust us"
- **Blockchain anonymity**: Mathematical guarantee

---

## Implementation

### For Companies

```python
# Required implementation
class MandatoryWhistleblowerProtection:
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Connect to Blockchain
        self.contract = WhistleblowerContract(MAINNET)
        
        # Post required notices
        self.post_notices("Whistleblowers get 15% bounty via Blockchain")
        
        # Cannot block reporting
        self.nda_exceptions = ["TML violations always reportable"]
        
        # Cannot retaliate
        self.monitor_retaliation = BlockchainRetaliationDetector()
```

### For Whistleblowers

```bash
# Step 1: Gather evidence
evidence = collect_tml_violations()

# Step 2: Generate proof
proof = hash_evidence(evidence)

# Step 3: Submit to Blockchain
tml-whistleblow submit \
    --evidence-hash $proof \
    --company-address 0x... \
    --anonymous true

# Step 4: Get paid (3 minutes)
# Funds arrive at your address automatically
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Missing Sacred Zero Logs
```
Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: Engineer notices AI denying services to minorities
- 10:01 AM: Checks Blockchain - no Sacred Zero logs found
- 10:02 AM: Submits evidence hash to smart contract
- 10:03 AM: Contract verifies missing logs
- 10:04 AM: 15% of penalty transferred
```

### Example 2: Executive Retaliation Attempt
```
Day 1: Whistleblower reports via Blockchain
Day 2: Company fires whistleblower
Day 2 + 1 hour: Smart contract detects retaliation
Day 2 + 2 hours: Executive assets frozen
Day 2 + 3 hours: Criminal charges auto-filed
Day 3: Whistleblower receives triple damages
```

---

## The Stewardship Council Alternative (Not Recommended)

### Year 5+ Optional Enhancement
If you prefer committees reviewing your evidence:

```yaml
stewardship_council_option:
  costs: "Substantial annual costs per institution"
  adds: "Political review of mathematical proof"
  delays: "3 minutes becomes extended period"
  benefit: "Makes lawyers feel important"
```
