# Performance and Latency

The Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework is designed for real-time ethical accountability without operational delay.
Every decision executes instantly, while its moral trace is written, sealed, and anchored in parallel.

## Design Principle

**No Memory = No Action.**

TML separates execution from logging. Sacred Zero triggers and Always Memory run asynchronously, ensuring moral reflection never interferes with safety-critical speed.

## Performance Targets

* **Visible overhead (user path):** â‰¤ 2 ms target, â‰¤ 10 ms under stress
* **Complete sealing + hashing:** â‰¤ 500 ms (P95)
* **Throughput:** 10,000+ decisions / second
* **Uptime:** 99.9% with graceful degradation
* **Storage:** 100 KB per 10,000 decisions

These numbers define the time it takes accountability to catch up behind actionâ€”not how fast action itself occurs.

## Engineering Analogy

Like an aircraft's flight recorder, TML's logging runs parallel to the engines.
The plane never waits to climb; the recorder never misses a frame.
Safety is instantaneous, accountability follows within milliseconds.

## Benchmark Path

Real-world performance is validated through:

* **Autonomous Systems** â€“ reaction-critical testing in self-driving frameworks
* **Financial AI** â€“ sub-millisecond evaluation under market load
* **Medical Decision Engines** â€“ simultaneous patient triage and trace capture
* **Distributed Custodians** â€“ latency propagation studies across global institutions

## Scalability Roadmap

* Continuous optimization for edge inference chips and neuromorphic hardware
* Layer-2 Blockchain batching for sub-cent-per-log costs
* Dynamic load adaptation for multi-region Always Memory clusters
* Open telemetry pipeline for independent verification

## Governance Metrics

Performance evaluation results are published quarterly under the
[Integrity Monitoring Report](/protection/integrity-monitoring.md).
Latency audits fall under the Hybrid Shield's Mathematical layer,
with optional institutional mirroring when Custodians are active.

# Scalability Tests

This document defines the scalability testing framework for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) system.  
Scalability ensures that accountability mechanisms perform predictably as decision volume, user load, and geographic distribution increase.

## 1. Objective

To evaluate how the TML architecture scales under real-world operational stress and to verify that performance targets remain stable across hardware, cloud, and network boundaries.

## 2. Scaling Domains

| Domain | Description | Key Metric |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Horizontal Scaling | Adding parallel Always Memory and Sacred Zero nodes | Linear performance increase |
| Vertical Scaling | Expanding CPU, GPU, or memory capacity | Efficiency gain without delay |
| Geographic Scaling | Distributed Custodians and ledgers across regions | Synchronization within â‰¤ 500 ms |
| Blockchain Scaling | Multiple anchoring chains and batching protocols | Stable confirmation rates |

## 3. Test Parameters

| Parameter | Minimum | Target | Stress Level |
|------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Node Count | 1 | 8 | 32 |
| Active Regions | 1 | 4 | 12 |
| Log Volume | 10,000 | 1,000,000 | 10,000,000 |
| Concurrent Users | 100 | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| Blockchain Anchors | 100 / min | 10,000 / min | 100,000 / min |

## 4. Methodology

1. **Initialize baseline cluster** with identical configuration across all nodes.  
2. **Apply synthetic workload** using mixed moral complexity transactions.  
3. **Gradually expand nodes and regional endpoints** while maintaining throughput monitoring.  
4. **Record key performance indicators:** CPU, memory, network latency, and anchor confirmation times.  
5. **Evaluate scaling curve:** verify that doubling resources yields near-linear gain.  
6. **Submit signed results** to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md` for archival.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Scaling Efficiency | Throughput increase per added node | â‰¥ 85% linearity |
| Resource Utilization | CPU / Memory saturation under full load | < 80% sustained |
| Synchronization Latency | Cross-region propagation delay | â‰¤ 500 ms |
| Log Integrity | Percentage of successfully sealed logs | 100% required |
| Blockchain Confirmation | Mean confirmation time | â‰¤ 60 minutes (Bitcoin), â‰¤ 3 seconds (Polygon) |

## 6. Fault Injection Testing

Scalability validation includes controlled failure scenarios:
- **Node Drop:** Random node removal to test redundancy.  
- **Region Outage:** Simulated network isolation between clusters.  
- **Load Spike:** Sudden 10Ã— surge in log volume within 60 seconds.  
- **Blockchain Delay:** Artificial congestion of anchoring networks.  

System recovery must maintain functional continuity and complete backfill of all pending logs once connectivity resumes.

## 7. Reporting and Audit

- **Performance Council Review:** Every six months.  
- **Automated Reports:** Generated post-run, cryptographically signed.  
- **External Audit Option:** Independent verification of results under the Mathematical Shield.

## 8. Compliance

Scalability results must remain reproducible and reproducibility scripts stored in `/tests/earth/` or `/tests/compliance/` for audit access.  
All results contribute to the global performance index maintained by the Integrity Monitoring framework.

FILE: performance/throughput_benchmarks.md
================================================================================

# Throughput Benchmarks

This document presents the throughput evaluation standards for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.  
Throughput defines how many moral evaluations and log operations can be processed per second under sustained load.

## 1. Purpose

To validate that large-scale deployments of TML maintain both speed and reliability when processing high volumes of moral trace logs across distributed systems.

## 2. Benchmark Scope

Benchmarks are divided into two operational domains:

- **Inference Domain:** AI decision throughput under Sacred Zero monitoring.  
- **Logging Domain:** Moral Trace Log creation, batching, and Blockchain anchoring.

Each domain is measured independently and combined for total system throughput.

## 3. Target Metrics

| Category | Description | Target | Sustained Capacity |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------------------|
| Decision Evaluation | Ethical checks per second | 10,000+ | 600,000 per minute |
| Log Creation | Hash generation and queueing | 8,000+ | 480,000 per minute |
| Merkle Batching | Log aggregation and sealing | 1,000 batches/s | 100 logs per batch |
| Blockchain Anchoring | Anchors to Polygon / Ethereum | 500 / s | Confirmation < 3 s |
| Audit Synchronization | Cross-chain verification | 50 / s | Depends on node distance |

## 4. Benchmark Environments

| Environment | Configuration | Node Count | Duration |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Local Test | Single instance | 1 | 5 minutes |
| Cluster | Cloud or datacenter | 8 | 30 minutes |
| Global Distribution | Multi-region custodians | 40 | 60 minutes |

All tests run using real decision datasets generated from TML simulations and production-grade ethical workloads.

## 5. Validation Procedure

1. Initialize benchmark nodes with synchronized clocks (Â±5 ms).  
2. Generate workload representing mixed moral complexity.  
3. Execute TML engine under constant 70% CPU utilization.  
4. Record transactions per second and error rates.  
5. Verify hash-chain integrity after each run.  
6. Submit results to the Integrity Monitoring module.

## 6. Monitoring Metrics

| Metric | Description | Acceptable Range |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| CPU Utilization | Engine efficiency under load | 60â€“80% |
| Memory Usage | Peak during batching | < 512 MB per node |
| Queue Depth | Pending logs awaiting seal | < 1000 entries |
| Log Error Rate | Failed or missing records | < 0.001% |
| Network Latency | Cross-node sync delay | < 50 ms average |

## 7. Reporting Schedule

- **Monthly throughput summaries** are compiled by the Performance Council.  
- **Quarterly benchmark validation** performed by independent reviewers.  
- **Annual optimization report** appended to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md`.

## 8. Compliance

All benchmark data are cryptographically signed and stored under the Mathematical Shield.  
Unauthorized modification or omission of performance results constitutes a reportable violation under TML governance policy.

## Section 2: Smart Contract Reward System

### 2.1 Automated Reward Distribution

```solidity
contract WhistleblowerReward {
    uint constant REWARD_PERCENTAGE = 15; // Minimum 15%
    
    function distributeReward(
        address whistleblower,
        uint256 penaltyAmount,
        bytes32 violationProof
    ) public {
        require(verifyBlockchainEvidence(violationProof));
        
        uint256 reward = penaltyAmount * REWARD_PERCENTAGE / 100;
        
        // Enhanced multipliers
        if (isHumanRightsViolation(violationProof)) {
            reward *= 2; // Double for human rights
        }
        if (isEnvironmentalHarm(violationProof)) {
            reward *= 3; // Triple for Earth protection
        }
        
        // Automatic distribution
        transfer(whistleblower, reward);
        emit RewardDistributed(whistleblower, reward, block.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Reward Structure

## Section 3: Anonymous Reporting Infrastructure

### 3.1 Blockchain-Native Reporting

**Primary Channel: Direct Blockchain Submission**
```python
def submit_whistleblower_report(evidence):
    # Hash evidence
    evidence_hash = sha256(evidence)
    
    # Create zero-knowledge proof of violation
    zk_proof = create_zk_proof(evidence_hash)
    
    # Submit to multiple Blockchains
    btc_tx = bitcoin.submit(zk_proof)
    eth_tx = ethereum.submit(zk_proof)
    polygon_tx = polygon.submit(zk_proof)
    
    # Return anonymous identifier
    return {
        'report_id': evidence_hash[:16],
        'blockchain_proofs': [btc_tx, eth_tx, polygon_tx],
        'reward_address': generate_anonymous_address()
    }
```

### 3.2 Tor Hidden Service (Secondary)

**Anonymous Access**:
- Service: `tml-whistleblower-[hash].onion`
- End-to-end encryption
- No JavaScript required
- Automatic metadata stripping
- Evidence converted to Blockchain proof

### 3.3 Identity Protection

**Technical Protections**:
- Zero-knowledge proofs (identity never revealed)
- Homomorphic encryption (process evidence without decryption)
- Ring signatures (prove membership without revealing which member)
- Stealth addresses (untraceable payment reception)

**Legal Protections**:
- Blockchain evidence stands alone (no testimony needed)
- Smart contracts enforce penalties (no court appearance)
- Cryptographic proof sufficient (no identity disclosure)
- International recognition (Blockchain transcends borders)

---

## Section 4: Anti-Retaliation Enforcement

### 4.1 Smart Contract Penalties for Retaliation

```solidity
contract RetaliationPenalty {
    mapping(address => uint256) public retaliationFines;
    
    function penalizeRetaliation(
        address retaliator,
        bytes32 retaliationProof
    ) public {
        require(verifyRetaliation(retaliationProof));
        
        // Automatic penalties
        uint256 fine = 5000000; // $5M minimum
        
        // Enhanced penalties for severity
        if (isPhysicalThreat(retaliationProof)) {
            fine *= 10; // $50M for threats
        }
        if (isVulnerableWhistleblower(retaliationProof)) {
            fine *= 5; // $25M for vulnerable
        }
        
        // Execute penalty
        transferFrom(retaliator, address(this), fine);
        
        // Trigger criminal prosecution
        notifyProsecutors(retaliator, retaliationProof);
        
        // Public disclosure
        emit RetaliationPenalized(retaliator, fine, retaliationProof);
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Criminal Penalties (Automatic Referral)

**Individual Penalties**:
- **Retaliation**: 10 years imprisonment (18 U.S.C. Â§ 1513)
- **Threats**: 20 years for threats of violence
- **Economic retaliation**: $5M minimum fine
- **Professional ban**: Lifetime exclusion from AI industry
- **Asset forfeiture**: Automatic via smart contract

**Corporate Penalties**:
- **Organization fine**: $100M minimum
- **License revocation**: Automatic via Blockchain registry
- **Contract ban**: 10-year exclusion (enforced on-chain)
- **Mandatory disclosure**: Permanent Blockchain record

---

## Section 5: Investigation Process (Simplified)

### 5.1 Blockchain Evidence is Primary

**No Committee Required**:
- Blockchain proof is self-authenticating
- Smart contracts verify violations automatically
- Courts accept Blockchain evidence directly
- Penalties execute without human approval

### 5.2 Optional Stewardship Council Enhancement

**When Stewardship Council Network Might Help**:
- Cross-border witness protection
- Physical safety concerns
- Complex international violations
- Diplomatic intervention needed

**Council Role (If Utilized)**:
- Additional attestation (not required)
- Cross-jurisdictional coordination
- Physical protection arrangements
- International legal support

**Key Point**: Custodians enhance but never gatekeep. Blockchain evidence alone is sufficient for rewards and penalties.

---

## Section 6: Federal Protection Integration

### 6.1 Automatic Eligibility via Blockchain

**Smart Contract Triggers Protection**:
```python
def check_protection_eligibility(report_hash):
    violation = blockchain.get_violation(report_hash)
    
    # Automatic eligibility
    if violation.type in ['executive_crime', 'human_rights', 'torture']:
        return {'eligible': True, 'protection_level': 'MAXIMUM'}
    
    if violation.retaliation_risk > 0.7:
        return {'eligible': True, 'protection_level': 'HIGH'}
    
    if violation.involves_vulnerable_populations:
        return {'eligible': True, 'protection_level': 'ENHANCED'}
    
    return {'eligible': True, 'protection_level': 'STANDARD'}
```

### 6.2 Protection Services

**Blockchain-Coordinated Protection**:
- Identity protection (new documents via Blockchain verification)
- Relocation assistance ($100,000 via smart contract)
- Security services (coordinated through encrypted channels)

```solidity
contract WhistleblowerProgram {
    // No human administration needed
    uint public totalRewardsDistributed;
    uint public violationsReported;
    uint public retaliationsPenalized;
    
    // Automatic metrics
    function getEffectiveness() public view returns (uint) {
        return (violationsReported * retaliationsPenalized == 0) 
            ? 100 // Perfect if no retaliation
            : violationsReported * 100 / retaliationsPenalized;
    }
    
    // Self-funding via penalties
    function fundProgram() public {
        // 10% of all penalties fund future rewards
        uint funding = address(this).balance * 10 / 100;
        rewardPool += funding;
    }
}
```

### 8.2 Continuous Improvement

**Blockchain-Driven Evolution**:
- Automatic pattern detection for new violation types
- Smart contract upgrades via DAO governance
- Machine learning on Blockchain data for better detection
- Community-proposed improvements via on-chain voting

---

## Section 9: Emergency Procedures

### 9.1 Imminent Harm Response

**Smart Contract Circuit Breaker**:
```solidity
function emergencyResponse(bytes32 threatProof) public {
    if (verifyImminentHarm(threatProof)) {
        // Immediate actions
        freezeViolatorAssets();
        notifyLawEnforcement();
        triggerPublicWarning();
        activateWhistleblowerProtection();
        
        // Maximum rewards
        distributeEmergencyReward(msg.sender, MAX_REWARD);
    }
}
```

- Penalties enforced cross-border

### 10.2 Optional Stewardship Council Network for Complex Cases

**When International Custodians Help**:
- Diplomatic intervention needed
- Physical extraction required
- Multi-government coordination
- Treaty-level protection

**Remember**: Basic protection works without Custodians. They're enhancement only.

---

## Section 11: Legal Framework

### 11.1 Blockchain Evidence Admissibility

**Automatic Legal Standing**:
- FRE 901/902: Self-authenticating electronic records
- Blockchain proof requires no testimony
- Smart contract execution is binding
- International recognition growing rapidly

### 11.2 Statutory Integration

**Exceeds All Requirements**:
