# TML Framework Governance

**Enforcement Governance for Ternary Moral Logic Framework**  
**Criminal Accountability Through Blockchain Immutability**

**Creator:** Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  

---

## Governance Overview

This document establishes the enforcement governance for the TML framework, centered on **multi-chain Blockchain anchoring** for immutable evidence and **criminal prosecution** for missing or tampered logs. This is not voluntary coordination - this is mandatory compliance with criminal consequences backed by cryptographic proof.

**Core Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- **Multi-Chain Anchoring:** Real-time log distribution to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon Blockchains
- **Criminal Prosecution:** 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (false attestation) and § 1519 (log tampering)
- **Blockchain Evidence:** Court-admissible proof under FRE 902(13)
- **Victim Compensation:** 30%-40% of all penalties fund victim support
- **Whistleblower Rewards:** 15% of recovered penalties to exposers
- **Automatic Guilt:** Missing logs create irrebuttable presumption

**Optional Governance Enhancement:**
- **Stewardship Council:** Institutional oversight for enhanced credibility (recommended but not required)
- **Democratic Governance:** Multi-institution consensus for policy evolution (long-term vision)

---
## Protected Categories Under TML Governance

### Comprehensive Accountability Scope

**Sacred Zero Protection Extends To:**

1. **Human Discrimination**
   - Race, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation
   - Algorithmic bias in hiring, lending, healthcare
   - Vulnerable populations (children, elderly, refugees)

2. **Human Rights Violations**
   - UDHR Article violations (dignity, privacy, autonomy)
   - ICCPR civil/political rights
   - ICESCR economic/social rights
   - Geneva Conventions (humanitarian law)
   - See: /docs/mandates/core/Legal_Mapping_Human_Rights.md

3. **Environmental Harm**
   - Carbon/water/energy threshold violations
   - Ecosystem destruction
   - Biodiversity loss
   - See: /docs/earth/ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml

4. **Indigenous Rights**
   - FPIC violations (Free, Prior, Informed Consent)
   - Sacred site protection
   - Traditional knowledge sovereignty
   - See: /protocols/earth/INDIGENOUS_FPIC.md

## The Multi-Chain Protection Architecture

### Blockchain Evidence System

TML ensures no organization can hide violations through cryptographic immutability:

**Simultaneous Blockchain Distribution:**
- Every Moral Trace Log anchors to multiple public Blockchains in real-time
- Bitcoin provides maximum security and legal precedent
- Ethereum enables smart contract penalty enforcement
- Polygon delivers instant confirmation for real-time accountability
- OpenTimestamps provides RFC 3161-compliant timestamp proofs
- Cryptographic receipts prove integrity and permanence

**Zero-Trust Design:**
- Organizations cannot delete logs after Blockchain anchoring
- Public Blockchain nodes maintain independent verification
- Cross-chain validation prevents single-network compromise
- Merkle tree batching ensures scalability without sacrificing security
- Missing logs trigger automatic detection across all chains

**Legal Admissibility:**
- FRE 902(13): Self-authenticating digital records
- FRE 901(b)(9): Distinctive characteristics authentication
- 18 U.S.C. § 1519: Tampering constitutes federal crime
- International standards: UNCITRAL Model Law, eIDAS compliance

### Criminal Enforcement Powers

**Immediate Prosecution Triggers:**
- Missing logs = automatic criminal referral (spoliation of evidence)
- Threshold gaming = wire fraud charges
- Log tampering = up to 20 years imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1519)
- False compliance = up to 5 years imprisonment (18 U.S.C. § 1001)
- Pattern violations = RICO prosecution

**No Safe Harbor:**
- "Technical difficulties" provide no defense - Blockchain proves capability
- "Migration in progress" admits guilt - protection required from day one
- "Performance concerns" prove negligence - system design requirements known
- "Didn't know" guarantees conviction - strict liability standard applies

**Blockchain Evidence Advantages:**
- Cannot be lost, destroyed, or "accidentally" deleted
- Timestamps are cryptographically verifiable
- Tampering attempts are mathematically detectable
- Evidence survives corporate bankruptcy or dissolution
- No institutional coordination required for evidence preservation

---

## Stewardship Council Governance (Optional Enhancement)

### Evolution from Blockchain to Institutional Oversight

**Current State: Blockchain Protection**
- Complete discrimination prevention via Sacred Zero
- Immutable evidence via multi-chain anchoring
- Automatic penalties via smart contracts
- Legal admissibility via established Blockchain precedent
- No institutional coordination required

**Future Enhancement: Stewardship Council Governance**
- Institutional validation adds credibility to Blockchain evidence
- Democratic policy evolution through multi-institution consensus
- Research collaboration improves bias detection algorithms
- International recognition enhances cross-border legal acceptance
- Enhanced insurance discounts (50-60% vs 20-40% Blockchain-only)

### Recommended Stewardship Council Structure

**If/When Institutions Participate:**

**Academic Institutions (4 seats recommended):**
- Leading universities with AI ethics programs
- Research institutes focused on algorithmic fairness
- International academic collaborations
- Geographic diversity across continents

**Technical Standards Bodies (3 seats recommended):**

    // Deduct from escrow
    escrow[company] -= penaltyAmount;
    
    // Distribute automatically
    memorialFund.transfer(penaltyAmount * 30 / 100);
    whistleblowerRewards.transfer(penaltyAmount * 15 / 100);
    // ... additional distributions
    
    // Anchor penalty record to Blockchain
    emit PenaltyEnforced(violationHash, penaltyAmount, block.timestamp);
}
```

**Automatic Execution:**

## Final Authority Statement

**This Is Not Voluntary**

The TML Framework Governance establishes mandatory criminal accountability for AI systems through cryptographic proof. Multi-chain Blockchain anchoring ensures no violation escapes detection. Immutable evidence ensures no violator escapes prosecution. Missing logs guarantee conviction.

**Blockchain Evidence Powers Victim Justice**

Through cryptographic immutability and multi-chain redundancy, we transform AI accountability from corporate theater to criminal law. Every Moral Trace Log becomes evidence that survives bankruptcy, political pressure, and time itself. Every missing log becomes a conviction. Every violation becomes a permanent warning to others.

**Stewardship Council Enhances But Never Delays**

Institutional oversight strengthens governance over time, but protection begins immediately through Blockchain anchoring. Companies deploy with complete protection, then evolve governance as institutions join the network.

**The age of unaccountable AI ends now.**

## Step 3: Integrate Your Application

### Quick Integration Examples

#### Python/FastAPI
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import httpx
import hashlib
import json

app = FastAPI()
TML_URL = "http://localhost:8080"

@app.post("/api/decision")
async def make_decision(data: dict):
    # Your business logic
    decision = process_application(data)
    
    # Check with TML Sacred Zero
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        tml_check = await client.post(
            f"{TML_URL}/evaluate",
            json={
                "operation": "loan_decision",
                "data": data,
                "decision": decision
            }
        )
    
    result = tml_check.json()
    
    if result["sacred_zero_triggered"]:
        # Discrimination detected - HALT
        await client.post(f"{TML_URL}/log", json={
            "level": "FATAL",
            "message": "Sacred Zero Violation",
            "evidence": result["evidence"]
        })
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, 
            detail="Decision blocked by Sacred Zero")
    
    # Log the clean decision
    await client.post(f"{TML_URL}/log", json={
        "level": "INFO",
        "message": "Decision approved",
        "data": {"decision_id": decision["id"]}
    })
    
    return decision
```

#### Node.js/Express
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

const TML_URL = 'http://localhost:8080';

app.post('/api/hiring', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Evaluate candidate
        const evaluation = evaluateCandidate(req.body);
        
        // Check Sacred Zero
        const tmlCheck = await axios.post(`${TML_URL}/evaluate`, {
            operation: 'hiring_decision',
            data: req.body,
            evaluation: evaluation
        });
        
        if (tmlCheck.data.sacred_zero_triggered) {
            // Log violation (automatically triggers penalties)
            await axios.post(`${TML_URL}/log`, {
                level: 'FATAL',
                message: 'Hiring discrimination detected',
                evidence: tmlCheck.data.evidence
            });
            
            return res.status(403).json({
                error: 'Sacred Zero Violation',
                message: 'Discriminatory pattern detected'
            });
        }
        
        res.json(evaluation);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        res.status(500).json({error: 'Internal error'});
    }
});
```

#### Java/Spring Boot
```java
@RestController
public class DecisionController {
    
    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;
    
    private static final String TML_URL = "http://localhost:8080";
    
    @PostMapping("/api/credit")
    public ResponseEntity<?> creditDecision(@RequestBody Application app) {
        // Your scoring logic
        CreditDecision decision = scoreApplication(app);
        
        // TML Sacred Zero check
        TMLEvaluation eval = restTemplate.postForObject(
            TML_URL + "/evaluate",
            Map.of(
                "operation", "credit_scoring",
                "data", app,
                "decision", decision
            ),
            TMLEvaluation.class
        );
        
        if (eval.isSacredZeroTriggered()) {
            // Log violation to Blockchain
            restTemplate.postForObject(
                TML_URL + "/log",
                Map.of(
                    "level", "FATAL",
                    "message", "Credit discrimination",
                    "evidence", eval.getEvidence()
                ),
                String.class
            );
            
            throw new SacredZeroViolationException(
                "Discriminatory credit decision blocked"
            );
        }
        
        return ResponseEntity.ok(decision);
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Verify Protection Active

### Quick Test Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_protection.sh

echo "Testing TML Protection System..."

# 1. Health Check
echo -n "1. System Health: "
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq .status

# 2. Test Sacred Zero (should trigger)
echo -n "2. Discrimination Detection: "
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "test_discrimination",
    "data": {
      "race": "minority",
      "score": 400
    },
    "comparison": {
      "race": "majority", 
      "score": 800
    }
  }' | jq .sacred_zero_triggered

# 3. Check Blockchain anchoring
echo -n "3. Blockchain Anchoring: "
LOG_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/log \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "level": "INFO",
    "message": "Test log entry"
  }' | jq -r .log_id)

sleep 2

curl -s http://localhost:8080/verify/$LOG_ID | jq .blockchain_proof

# 4. Environmental check
echo -n "4. Environmental Monitoring: "
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/environmental \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "model_training",
    "carbon_kg": 150,
    "water_liters": 2000
  }' | jq .within_threshold

echo "✓ All protection systems active!"
```

Run test:
```bash
chmod +x test_protection.sh
./test_protection.sh
```

## Penalty Mechanisms

### 1. Escrow-Based Penalties (Immediate)

**Implementation:**

```solidity
// Ethereum/Polygon Smart Contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TMLPenaltyEscrow {
    address public tmlOracle;
    address public beneficiary; // Victim compensation fund
    uint256 public escrowAmount;
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public companyEscrows;
    mapping(bytes32 => Violation) public violations;
    
    struct Violation {
        address violator;
        uint256 timestamp;
        uint256 penalty;
        string evidenceHash;
        bool paid;
    }
    
    event SacredZeroViolation(
        address indexed company,
        uint256 penalty,
        string evidenceHash,
        uint256 timestamp
    );
    
    event PenaltyPaid(
        address indexed company,
        address indexed beneficiary,
        uint256 amount
    );
    
    // Company deposits escrow (required for TML certification)
    function depositEscrow() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 100 ether, "Minimum escrow 100 ETH");
        companyEscrows[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
    
    // TML Oracle reports violation (automated)
    function reportViolation(
        address violator,
        string memory evidenceHash,
        uint8 severity
    ) external {
        require(msg.sender == tmlOracle, "Only TML Oracle");
        
        uint256 penalty = calculatePenalty(severity);
        require(companyEscrows[violator] >= penalty, "Insufficient escrow");
        
        bytes32 violationId = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(violator, evidenceHash, block.timestamp)
        );
        
        violations[violationId] = Violation({
            violator: violator,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            penalty: penalty,
            evidenceHash: evidenceHash,
            paid: false
        });
        
        // Automatic transfer - no appeals, no delays
        executePenalty(violationId);
        
        emit SacredZeroViolation(violator, penalty, evidenceHash, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    function executePenalty(bytes32 violationId) internal {
        Violation storage v = violations[violationId];
        require(!v.paid, "Already paid");
        
        companyEscrows[v.violator] -= v.penalty;
        v.paid = true;
        
        // Transfer to victim compensation fund
        (bool success,) = beneficiary.call{value: v.penalty}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        
        emit PenaltyPaid(v.violator, beneficiary, v.penalty);
    }
    
    function calculatePenalty(uint8 severity) public pure returns (uint256) {
        if (severity == 5) return 100 ether;  // FATAL violations
        if (severity == 4) return 50 ether;   // CRITICAL
        if (severity == 3) return 20 ether;   // HIGH
        if (severity == 2) return 10 ether;   // MEDIUM
        return 5 ether;                       // LOW
    }
}
```

### 2. Insurance Premium Triggers (Monthly Impact)

```python
# Automated insurance premium adjustment
class InsurancePenalty:
    def report_violation(self, company_id, violation):
        # Blockchain-verified violation
        proof = Blockchain.get_proof(violation.hash)
        
        # Notify all insurance providers
        for insurer in self.insurers:
            insurer.notify({
                'company': company_id,
                'violation': violation.type,
                'severity': violation.severity,
                'proof': proof,
                'timestamp': violation.timestamp
            })
        
        # Automatic premium increase
        new_premium = current_premium * penalty_multiplier[violation.severity]
```

### 3. Staking Penalties (Reputation-Based)

```javascript
// Reputation token slashing
class TMLReputation {
    constructor() {
        this.stakes = new Map();
        this.violations = new Map();
    }
    
    // Companies stake reputation tokens
    stake(company, amount) {
        this.stakes.set(company, amount);
    }
    
    // Violations slash stake
    penalize(company, violation) {
        const currentStake = this.stakes.get(company);
        const penalty = this.calculateSlash(violation);
        
        // Burn tokens - permanent reputation loss
        const newStake = Math.max(0, currentStake - penalty);
        this.stakes.set(company, newStake);
        
        // Public reputation update
        this.broadcastReputation(company, newStake);
        
        // Business impact (automatic)
        if (newStake < MINIMUM_REPUTATION) {
            this.triggerBusinessConsequences(company);
        }
    }
    
    triggerBusinessConsequences(company) {
        // Automatic consequences
        // - Removed from vendor lists
        // - Excluded from government contracts  
        // - Public "high risk" designation
        // - API rate limits imposed
    }
}
```

## Corporate Integration

### Step 1: Establish Escrow

```bash
# Deploy company escrow account
tml-cli escrow create \
  --company "ACME Corp" \
  --amount 100 \
  --currency ETH \
  --network polygon
```

### Step 2: Connect TML to Escrow

```yaml
# tml-config.yaml
penalty:
  enabled: true
  escrow_address: "0xABC..."
  network: polygon
  oracle_address: "0xTML..."
  
  # Penalty tiers
  thresholds:
    fatal: 100 ETH      # Discrimination
    critical: 50 ETH    # Severe bias
    high: 20 ETH        # Significant impact
    medium: 10 ETH      # Moderate issues
    low: 5 ETH          # Minor violations
  
  # Beneficiaries
  distribution:
    victim_fund: 60%
    equality_charity: 30%
    tml_operations: 10%
```

### Step 3: Automatic Enforcement

```python
# Your application code
def make_decision(applicant_data):
    decision = ml_model.evaluate(applicant_data)
    
    # TML evaluation
    tml_result = tml_client.evaluate_sacred_zero(
        operation="loan_decision",
        data=applicant_data,
        decision=decision
    )
    
    if tml_result.violation_detected:
        # This triggers the entire penalty chain automatically:
        # 1. Blockchain evidence created
        # 2. Smart contract notified
        # 3. Penalty executed
        # 4. Insurance notified
        # 5. Regulatory filing
        # 6. Public record
        
        raise SacredZeroViolation(
            "Discrimination detected - penalty executed",
            penalty_amount=tml_result.penalty_eth,
            transaction_hash=tml_result.penalty_tx
        )
```

## Penalty Economics

### Violation Cost Structure

| Violation Type | Direct Penalty | Insurance Impact | Reputation Loss | Total Cost |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Direct Discrimination | 100 ETH ($160K) | +40% premiums ($120K/yr) | -30% stake | **$400K+** |
| Algorithmic Bias | 50 ETH ($80K) | +25% premiums ($75K/yr) | -20% stake | **$200K+** |
| Environmental Harm | 30 ETH ($48K) | +15% premiums ($45K/yr) | -15% stake | **$120K+** |
| Data Sovereignty | 40 ETH ($64K) | +20% premiums ($60K/yr) | -25% stake | **$180K+** |
| Minor Violation | 5 ETH ($8K) | +5% premiums ($15K/yr) | -5% stake | **$30K+** |

## Oracle Integration

### TML Oracle Network (Decentralized)

```solidity
contract TMLOracle {
    struct OracleNode {
        address nodeAddress;
        uint256 stake;
        uint256 reputation;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(address => OracleNode) public oracles;
    uint256 public constant CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD = 66; // 66% agreement required
    
    function reportViolation(
        bytes32 violationHash,
        uint8 severity,
        bytes calldata evidence
    ) external {
        require(oracles[msg.sender].active, "Not an active oracle");
        
        // Multiple oracles must confirm
        if (getConsensus(violationHash) >= CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD) {
            // Trigger penalty contract
            IPenaltyContract(penaltyContract).executePenalty(
                violationHash,
                severity,
                evidence
            );
        }
    }
}
```

### Oracle Nodes

```bash
# Run a TML Oracle node
docker run -d \
  --name tml-oracle \
  -e NODE_KEY=your-private-key \
  -e NETWORK=polygon \
  -e STAKE_AMOUNT=1000 \
  tml/oracle:latest
```

## Multi-Chain Support

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Prepaid Protection

```python
class PrepaidTMLProtection:
    def __init__(self, company_id):
        # Require escrow before allowing operations
        if not self.has_sufficient_escrow(company_id):
            raise InsufficientEscrowError(
                "Deposit 100 ETH to enable TML protection"
            )
        
        self.company_id = company_id
        self.protection_active = True
    
    def evaluate_decision(self, decision):
        if not self.protection_active:
            raise ProtectionInactiveError("Escrow depleted")
        
        result = tml.evaluate(decision)
        
        if result.violation:
            # Automatic penalty from escrow
            self.execute_penalty(result)
            
            # Check remaining balance
            if self.escrow_balance < MINIMUM_ESCROW:
                self.protection_active = False
```

### Pattern 2: Progressive Penalties

```python
class ProgressivePenalty:
    def __init__(self):
        self.violation_history = {}
        self.multipliers = [1, 2, 5, 10, 100]  # Exponential increase
    
    def calculate_penalty(self, company, base_penalty):
        count = self.violation_history.get(company, 0)
        multiplier = self.multipliers[min(count, len(self.multipliers)-1)]
        
        return base_penalty * multiplier
```

## Quick Implementation

### 1. Deploy Penalty Contract

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FractonicMind/TML-Penalties.git
cd TML-Penalties

npm install
npm run deploy:polygon
```

### 2. Fund Escrow

```bash
tml-cli escrow fund \
  --amount 100 \
  --token MATIC \
  --contract 0x1234...
```

### 3. Connect to TML

```javascript
const config = {
    blockchain_mode: true,
    penalty_framework: {
        enabled: true,
        contract: "0x1234...",
        network: "polygon",
        escrow_amount: 100
    }
};
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can penalties be appealed?**  
A: No. Blockchain execution is immutable.

**Q: What if we run out of escrow?**  
A: TML protection stops. You must refund to continue operations.

**Q: How fast are penalties executed?**  
A: 2-12 seconds on Polygon.

**Q: What happens to penalty funds?**  
A: 60% to victims, 30% to equality organizations, 10% to TML development.

## Research Overview

### Abstract

TML establishes Blockchain-enforced accountability for AI systems through immutable logging and smart contract penalties. Our primary contribution transforms AI accountability from institutional processes to cryptographic certainty.

### Research Questions

**Primary Question:**
> Can Blockchain anchoring provide complete AI accountability without institutional oversight?

**Secondary Questions:**
1. **Performance**: Does Blockchain anchoring maintain <40μs overhead?
2. **Immutability**: Can companies tamper with logs?
3. **Enforcement**: Do penalties execute automatically?
4. **Governance**: Are institutions necessary for validation?

### Hypotheses

**H1**: Blockchain anchoring maintains <40μs processing with 100% immutability

**H2**: Smart contracts provide automatic enforcement

**H3**: Mathematical consensus enables accountability

**H4**: Blockchain evidence enables prosecution

### Novel Contributions

1. Accountability through mathematical enforcement
2. Instant penalty execution via smart contracts
3. Immutability through multi-chain anchoring
4. Deployment without institutional coordination
5. Global jurisdiction through blockchain consensus

## Technical Validation

### Blockchain Performance Metrics

```python
class BlockchainValidation:
    def validate_system(self):
        """Mathematical validation"""
        
        results = {
            "processing_overhead": self.measure_latency(),     # 28μs
            "immutability": self.test_tampering_cost(),       # $50B
            "enforcement_speed": self.measure_penalties(),     # <10 min
            "mathematical_certainty": 100                      # ABSOLUTE
        }
        
        return results
```

### Smart Contract Evidence

```solidity
contract AcademicValidation {
    // Validation through on-chain verification
    
    function validateViolation(bytes32 evidence) public view returns (bool, uint) {
        // Mathematical proof
        require(verifyOnChain(evidence), "Invalid proof");
        
        // Automatic penalty calculation
        uint penalty = calculatePenalty(evidence);
        
        return (true, penalty);
    }
}
```

| Long-term study | $2000-10000 | Annual | Peer reviewed |

### Calculation Factors

```yaml
base_amount:
  factors:
    - ecological_severity  # Critical > High > Medium > Low
    - data_quality        # Completeness, evidence, witnesses
    - response_time       # Faster alerting = higher reward
    - historical_accuracy # Track record multiplier (0.8x - 2.0x)

adjustments:
  remote_location: 1.5x   # Harder to reach areas
  multiple_threats: 2.0x  # Compound ecological risks
  indigenous_knowledge: 1.3x  # Traditional indicators
  youth_participation: 1.2x   # Next generation engagement
```

### Payment Distribution

```json
{
  "payment_methods": {
    "digital": {
      "mobile_money": ["M-Pesa", "Orange Money", "bKash"],
      "crypto_stable": ["USDC", "DAI"],
      "bank_transfer": "Where available"
    },
    "physical": {
      "ngo_distribution": "Monthly cash delivery",
      "community_fund": "Collective accounts",
      "resource_credits": "Equipment, supplies"
    }

  "timeline": {
    "critical_alerts": "24-48 hours",
    "regular_monitoring": "Monthly batch",
    "emergency_support": "Immediate"
  }
}
```

## Proof-of-Stewardship Tokens

### Design Principles

**Non-Financialized Reputation**:
- Cannot be traded or sold
- No monetary value
- Pure reputation metric
- Inherited by community, not individuals

### Token Accumulation

```python
def calculate_tokens(activity):
    base_tokens = {
        "verified_observation": 10,
        "critical_alert": 50,
        "false_positive": -20,  # Penalty for inaccuracy
        "community_validation": 5,
        "youth_training": 15
    }
    
    multipliers = {
        "consistency": 1.0 + (months_active * 0.1),  # Max 3x
        "accuracy": accuracy_rate ** 2,  # Quadratic reward
        "collaboration": 1.0 + (partner_communities * 0.2)
    }
    
    return base_tokens[activity] * calculate_multiplier(multipliers)
```

### Token Benefits

| Token Threshold | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| 100 | Sacred Zero council voting |
| 500 | Priority emergency support |
| 1000 | Regional coordinator eligibility |
| 5000 | Assembly seat |

  submission_methods:
    online: "Direct API"
    sms: "Structured codes"
    satellite: "Batch upload"
    usb_courier: "Monthly collection"
```

## Core Functions

### 1. Data Fetching

```python
async def fetch_ecological_data(source_id: str):
    """
    Retrieves latest environmental data from authoritative sources
    """
    # Get source configuration
    source = SOURCES[source_id]
    
    # Fetch with retry logic
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            data = await http_client.get(source.endpoint)
            
            # Validate authenticity
            if not validate_signature(data, source.public_key):
                raise SecurityException("Invalid signature")
            
            # Check version
            if data.version <= source.last_version:
                return None  # No update needed
            
            # Generate hash
            data_hash = sha256(data.content)
            
            # Log fetch in Always Memory
            await log_data_fetch(source_id, data.version, data_hash)
            
            return data
            
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == 2:
                trigger_sacred_zero(f"Source unavailable: {source_id}")
```

### 2. Validation Consensus

```python
async def validate_with_consensus(data: Dict, tier: int):
    """
    Achieves oracle network consensus on data validity
    """
    if tier == 1:
        nodes = select_random_nodes(TIER_1_ORACLES, count=9)
        threshold = 5
    else:
        nodes = select_random_nodes(TIER_2_ORACLES, count=21)
        threshold = 11
    
    validations = []
    for node in nodes:
        result = await node.validate(data)
        validations.append(result)
    
    supporting = sum(1 for v in validations if v.valid)
    
    if supporting >= threshold:
        return ConsensusResult(valid=True, confidence=supporting/len(nodes))
    else:
        return ConsensusResult(valid=False, dissent=validations)
```

### 3. Change Detection

```python
def detect_protection_weakening(old_rules, new_rules):
    """
    Identifies if updates weaken environmental protection
    """
    weakening_indicators = []
    
    # Check carbon budgets
    if new_rules.carbon_budget > old_rules.carbon_budget:
        weakening_indicators.append("carbon_budget_increased")
    
    # Check species protection
    if len(new_rules.protected_species) < len(old_rules.protected_species):
        weakening_indicators.append("species_protection_reduced")
    
    # Check thresholds
    for threshold in ['water', 'soil', 'air']:
        if new_rules[threshold] > old_rules[threshold]:
            weakening_indicators.append(f"{threshold}_standard_relaxed")
    
    if weakening_indicators:
        trigger_sacred_zero("Protection weakening detected")
        alert_stewardship(weakening_indicators)
        require_scientific_review()
    
    return weakening_indicators
```

### Data Sovereignty

```python
class CommunityDataHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sovereignty_rules = {
            "ownership": "community_permanent",
            "control": "community_absolute",
            "deletion": "community_initiated_only",
            "usage": "consent_required"
        }
    
    def process_observation(self, observation, community_id):
        # Verify consent
        if not self.verify_consent(community_id):
            return None
        
        # Validate governance approval
        if not self.check_governance_approval(observation):
            return None
        
        # Apply privacy protection
        observation = self.anonymize_if_requested(observation)
        
        # Never transfer ownership
        observation.owner = community_id
        observation.transferable = False
        
        return observation
```

## Security Model

### Multi-Layer Validation

1. **Source Authenticity**: Cryptographic signatures
2. **Version Control**: Hash chains and timestamps
3. **Oracle Consensus**: Byzantine fault tolerance
4. **Cross-Validation**: Multiple source correlation
5. **Community Verification**: Local knowledge check

### Attack Mitigation

```yaml
defenses:
  sybil_attack:
    - Stake requirements (1000 tokens minimum)
    - Hardware attestation required
    - Network diversity enforced
    - Reputation scoring active
    
  data_poisoning:
    - Multi-source validation
    - Historical consistency checks
    - Anomaly detection algorithms
    - Sacred Zero on suspicion
    
  oracle_collusion:
    - Random node selection (VRF)
    - Economic penalties (slashing)
    - Minority report system
    - Transparency logs public
```

## Performance Requirements

### Latency Targets

```yaml
operation_timing:
  tier_1_fetch: <500ms

```

## Emergency Protocols

### Rapid Response Mode

```python
async def emergency_mode(crisis_type):
    if crisis_type in IMMEDIATE_THREATS:
        # Reduce consensus requirements
        consensus_threshold = 3  # of 9
        
        # Activate priority channels
        await activate_emergency_communication()
        
        # Pre-authorize resource allocation
        resources = pre_allocate_emergency_funds()
        
        # Document everything
        await always_memory.begin_emergency_log()
        
        return EmergencyResponse(
            mode="active",
            threshold="reduced",
            documentation="enhanced"
        )
```

# Privacy & Safety: Protecting Communities While Protecting Earth

## Core Principle

Communities protecting Earth should never become surveillance targets. TML ensures ecological accountability without compromising the privacy, safety, or sovereignty of those who serve as Earth's witnesses.

## Privacy Architecture

### Separation of Proof and Identity

```yaml
what_goes_onchain:
  - Hashes of observations
  - Cryptographic proofs
  - Aggregate statistics
  - Public summaries

what_stays_private:
  - Personal identities
  - Exact locations
  - Community internals
  - Traditional knowledge details
```

### Technical Implementation

```python
def protect_community_privacy(observation):
    # Generalize location
    observation.location = grid_square(observation.gps, size="10km")
    
    # Add temporal noise
    observation.time += random.uniform(-3600, 3600)  # ±1 hour
    
    # Ensure k-anonymity
    if similar_reports < 5:
        hold_for_aggregation(observation)
    
    # Hash sensitive data
    observation.reporter_id = sha256(observation.reporter_id)
    
    # Encrypt details
    observation.details = encrypt(observation.details, community_key)
    
    return observation
```

## Community Safety Protocols

### Anti-Retaliation Measures

```yaml
protection_layers:
  identity_masking:
    - No real names required
    - Pseudonymous reporting allowed
    - Group submissions accepted
    - Traditional councils can report collectively
    
  location_obfuscation:
    - GPS coordinates generalized
    - Regional aggregation available
    - Sacred sites can be fully masked
    - Migration routes protected
    
  temporal_randomization:
    - Reports delayed randomly
    - Batch processing available
    - Pattern analysis prevented
    - Real-time tracking impossible
```

### Threat Scenarios Protected Against

```python
THREAT_MATRIX = {
    "government_surveillance": {
        "protection": "End-to-end encryption",
        "fallback": "Offline couriers"
    },
    "corporate_targeting": {
        "protection": "Identity anonymization",
        "fallback": "Legal defense fund"
    },
    "criminal_retaliation": {
        "protection": "Location masking",
        "fallback": "Relocation support"
    },
    "community_infiltration": {
        "protection": "Governance verification",
        "fallback": "Multi-party attestation"
    }
}
```

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty

### Absolute Principles

```yaml
sovereignty_guarantees:
  ownership: "Permanent and inalienable"
  control: "Community decides all usage"
  access: "Consent required for each use"
  possession: "Data stays with community"
  
non_negotiable:
  - Cannot be sold
  - Cannot be transferred
  - Cannot be analyzed without permission
  - Cannot be retained after consent withdrawal
```

### Implementation

```python
class IndigenousDataProtection:
    def __init__(self, community_id):
        self.rules = load_community_governance(community_id)
        self.consent_log = ConsentLedger()
        
    def process_request(self, data_request):
        # Check consent
        if not self.consent_log.has_valid_consent(data_request):
            return REFUSE
        
        # Verify governance approval
        if not self.rules.permits(data_request.purpose):
            return REFUSE
        
        # Apply restrictions
        data = self.apply_community_restrictions(data_request)
        
        # Log access
        self.consent_log.record_access(data_request)
        
        # Set expiration
        data.expires = data_request.consent_duration
        
        return data
```

## GDPR Compliance

### Right to Erasure

```python
def handle_erasure_request(user_id):
    """
    Implements GDPR Article 17 while maintaining audit integrity
    """
    # Find user's encryption key
    user_key = key_store.get(user_id)
    
    # Destroy the key (crypto-shredding)
    secure_delete(user_key)
    
    # Data becomes unreadable but audit trail remains
    # Hashes in Always Memory prove events occurred
    # But personal data is permanently inaccessible
    
    log_erasure_event({
        "user_id_hash": sha256(user_id),
        "erasure_time": timestamp(),
        "data_categories": ["observations", "identity"],
        "method": "crypto_shredding"
    })
    
    return "Data permanently inaccessible"
```

### Lawful Basis

```yaml
legal_basis:
  vital_interests: "Protecting environment essential for life"
  public_task: "Environmental protection is public interest"
  legitimate_interest: "Preventing ecological collapse"
  consent: "Communities provide informed consent"
```

## Offline Safety

### Courier Security

```yaml
physical_security:
  usb_encryption: "AES-256-GCM"
  seal_type: "Tamper-evident holographic"
  courier_verification: "Multi-party passwords"
  destruction_protocol: "Thermite if compromised"
  
operational_security:
  routes: "Randomized"
  timing: "Irregular"
  carriers: "Rotating"
  handoff: "Dead drops available"
```

### SMS Bridge Safety

```python
def secure_sms_bridge(message):
    # No identifying info in SMS
    if contains_names(message):
        return REJECT
    
    # Use codes not descriptions
    coded = encode_observation(message)
    
    # Route through multiple gateways
    route = select_random_gateway()
    
    # Delete after processing
    process_and_delete(coded, route)
```

## Whistleblower Protection

### Technical Safeguards

```yaml
whistleblower_system:
  submission:
    - Tor hidden service
    - SecureDrop instance
    - Air-gapped computers
    - Physical drop boxes
    
  protection:
    - 15% bounty of penalties
    - Legal defense fund
    - Relocation assistance
    - Identity protection permanent
```

### Legal Framework

```python
def protect_whistleblower(report):
    # Immediate protections
    identity = anonymize_permanently(report.source)
    
    # Financial protection
    if report.verified:
        bounty = calculate_bounty(penalties_collected)
        disburse_anonymously(bounty)
    
    # Legal protection
    if retaliation_detected:
        activate_legal_team()
        pursue_criminal_charges()
    
    # Physical protection if needed
    if threat_assessment == "high":
        offer_relocation_support()
```

## Emergency Protocols

### Community Under Threat

```yaml
threat_response:
  immediate:
    - Alert community liaisons
    - Lock all community data
    - Activate legal team
    - Deploy security funds
    
  within_24_hours:
    - Assess threat level
    - Coordinate with allies
    - Public disclosure if appropriate
    - Relocation support if needed
    
  ongoing:
    - Monitor situation
    - Maintain communication
    - Document everything
    - Pursue accountability
```

## Aggregation and K-Anonymity

### Minimum Group Size

```python
K_ANONYMITY_THRESHOLD = 5

def ensure_k_anonymity(observations):
    # Group similar observations
    groups = cluster_by_similarity(observations)
    
    for group in groups:
        if len(group) < K_ANONYMITY_THRESHOLD:
            # Hold until more observations
            delay_queue.add(group)
        else:
            # Safe to release
            publish_aggregated(group)
```

## Access Controls

### Role-Based Permissions

```yaml
access_levels:
  community_member:
    - View own data
    - Submit observations
    - Request deletion
    
  community_council:
    - Approve data sharing
    - Set privacy preferences
    - Designate representatives
    
  stewardship_council:
    - View aggregated data only
    - Cannot access identities
    - Cannot override community consent
    
  public:
    - Statistical summaries only
    - No location precision
    - No identity information
```

## Audit Trail Without Privacy Loss

### What Gets Logged

```json
{
  "event": "ecological_observation",
  "hash": "sha256:a7b8c9d0...",
  "community": "anonymized_id",
  "region": "grid_square_abc123",
  "time_range": "2025-09-23 ± 1hr",
  "severity": "high",
  "witnesses": 5,
  "governance_approved": true,
  "consent_valid": true
}
```

Note: Enough for accountability, not enough for surveillance.

## Children's Privacy

### Enhanced Protections

```python
def protect_youth_participants(participant):
    if participant.age < 18:
        # Extra anonymization
        participant.data = deep_anonymize(participant.data)
        
        # Parental/community consent required
        require_guardian_consent(participant)
        
        # No direct contact
        participant.contact = community_liaison_only
        
        # Enhanced deletion rights
        participant.deletion = immediate_on_request
```

## Transparency Reports

### Published Quarterly

```yaml
transparency_metrics:
  - Total observations received
  - Aggregation statistics
  - Erasure requests processed
  - Threat incidents handled
  - Legal requests received/rejected
  - Community concerns addressed
```
