# Privacy & Safety: Protecting Communities While Protecting Earth

## Core Principle

Communities protecting Earth should never become surveillance targets. TML ensures ecological accountability without compromising the privacy, safety, or sovereignty of those who serve as Earth's witnesses.

## Privacy Architecture

### Separation of Proof and Identity

```yaml
what_goes_onchain:
  - Hashes of observations
  - Cryptographic proofs
  - Aggregate statistics
  - Public summaries

what_stays_private:
  - Personal identities
  - Exact locations
  - Community internals
  - Traditional knowledge details
```

### Technical Implementation

```python
def protect_community_privacy(observation):
    # Generalize location
    observation.location = grid_square(observation.gps, size="10km")
    
    # Add temporal noise
    observation.time += random.uniform(-3600, 3600)  # ±1 hour
    
    # Ensure k-anonymity
    if similar_reports < 5:
        hold_for_aggregation(observation)
    
    # Hash sensitive data
    observation.reporter_id = sha256(observation.reporter_id)
    
    # Encrypt details
    observation.details = encrypt(observation.details, community_key)
    
    return observation
```

## Community Safety Protocols

### Anti-Retaliation Measures

```yaml
protection_layers:
  identity_masking:
    - No real names required
    - Pseudonymous reporting allowed
    - Group submissions accepted
    - Traditional councils can report collectively
    
  location_obfuscation:
    - GPS coordinates generalized
    - Regional aggregation available
    - Sacred sites can be fully masked
    - Migration routes protected
    
  temporal_randomization:
    - Reports delayed randomly
    - Batch processing available
    - Pattern analysis prevented
    - Real-time tracking impossible
```

### Threat Scenarios Protected Against

```python
THREAT_MATRIX = {
    "government_surveillance": {
        "protection": "End-to-end encryption",
        "fallback": "Offline couriers"
    },
    "corporate_targeting": {
        "protection": "Identity anonymization",
        "fallback": "Legal defense fund"
    },
    "criminal_retaliation": {
        "protection": "Location masking",
        "fallback": "Relocation support"
    },
    "community_infiltration": {
        "protection": "Governance verification",
        "fallback": "Multi-party attestation"
    }
}
```

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty

### Absolute Principles

```yaml
sovereignty_guarantees:
  ownership: "Permanent and inalienable"
  control: "Community decides all usage"
  access: "Consent required for each use"
  possession: "Data stays with community"
  
non_negotiable:
  - Cannot be sold
  - Cannot be transferred
  - Cannot be analyzed without permission
  - Cannot be retained after consent withdrawal
```

### Implementation

```python
class IndigenousDataProtection:
    def __init__(self, community_id):
        self.rules = load_community_governance(community_id)
        self.consent_log = ConsentLedger()
        
    def process_request(self, data_request):
        # Check consent
        if not self.consent_log.has_valid_consent(data_request):
            return REFUSE
        
        # Verify governance approval
        if not self.rules.permits(data_request.purpose):
            return REFUSE
        
        # Apply restrictions
        data = self.apply_community_restrictions(data_request)
        
        # Log access
        self.consent_log.record_access(data_request)
        
        # Set expiration
        data.expires = data_request.consent_duration
        
        return data
```

## GDPR Compliance

### Right to Erasure

```python
def handle_erasure_request(user_id):
    """
    Implements GDPR Article 17 while maintaining audit integrity
    """
    # Find user's encryption key
    user_key = key_store.get(user_id)
    
    # Destroy the key (crypto-shredding)
    secure_delete(user_key)
    
    # Data becomes unreadable but audit trail remains
    # Hashes in Always Memory prove events occurred
    # But personal data is permanently inaccessible
    
    log_erasure_event({
        "user_id_hash": sha256(user_id),
        "erasure_time": timestamp(),
        "data_categories": ["observations", "identity"],
        "method": "crypto_shredding"
    })
    
    return "Data permanently inaccessible"
```

### Lawful Basis

```yaml
legal_basis:
  vital_interests: "Protecting environment essential for life"
  public_task: "Environmental protection is public interest"
  legitimate_interest: "Preventing ecological collapse"
  consent: "Communities provide informed consent"
```

## Offline Safety

### Courier Security

```yaml
physical_security:
  usb_encryption: "AES-256-GCM"
  seal_type: "Tamper-evident holographic"
  courier_verification: "Multi-party passwords"
  destruction_protocol: "Thermite if compromised"
  
operational_security:
  routes: "Randomized"
  timing: "Irregular"
  carriers: "Rotating"
  handoff: "Dead drops available"
```

### SMS Bridge Safety

```python
def secure_sms_bridge(message):
    # No identifying info in SMS
    if contains_names(message):
        return REJECT
    
    # Use codes not descriptions
    coded = encode_observation(message)
    
    # Route through multiple gateways
    route = select_random_gateway()
    
    # Delete after processing
    process_and_delete(coded, route)
```

## Whistleblower Protection

### Technical Safeguards

```yaml
whistleblower_system:
  submission:
    - Tor hidden service
    - SecureDrop instance
    - Air-gapped computers
    - Physical drop boxes
    
  protection:
    - 15% bounty of penalties
    - Legal defense fund
    - Relocation assistance
    - Identity protection permanent
```

### Legal Framework

```python
def protect_whistleblower(report):
    # Immediate protections
    identity = anonymize_permanently(report.source)
    
    # Financial protection
    if report.verified:
        bounty = calculate_bounty(penalties_collected)
        disburse_anonymously(bounty)
    
    # Legal protection
    if retaliation_detected:
        activate_legal_team()
        pursue_criminal_charges()
    
    # Physical protection if needed
    if threat_assessment == "high":
        offer_relocation_support()
```

## Emergency Protocols

### Community Under Threat

```yaml
threat_response:
  immediate:
    - Alert community liaisons
    - Lock all community data
    - Activate legal team
    - Deploy security funds
    
  within_24_hours:
    - Assess threat level
    - Coordinate with allies
    - Public disclosure if appropriate
    - Relocation support if needed
    
  ongoing:
    - Monitor situation
    - Maintain communication
    - Document everything
    - Pursue accountability
```

## Aggregation and K-Anonymity

### Minimum Group Size

```python
K_ANONYMITY_THRESHOLD = 5

def ensure_k_anonymity(observations):
    # Group similar observations
    groups = cluster_by_similarity(observations)
    
    for group in groups:
        if len(group) < K_ANONYMITY_THRESHOLD:
            # Hold until more observations
            delay_queue.add(group)
        else:
            # Safe to release
            publish_aggregated(group)
```

## Access Controls

### Role-Based Permissions

```yaml
access_levels:
  community_member:
    - View own data
    - Submit observations
    - Request deletion
    
  community_council:
    - Approve data sharing
    - Set privacy preferences
    - Designate representatives
    
  stewardship_council:
    - View aggregated data only
    - Cannot access identities
    - Cannot override community consent
    
  public:
    - Statistical summaries only
    - No location precision
    - No identity information
```

## Audit Trail Without Privacy Loss

### What Gets Logged

```json
{
  "event": "ecological_observation",
  "hash": "sha256:a7b8c9d0...",
  "community": "anonymized_id",
  "region": "grid_square_abc123",
  "time_range": "2025-09-23 ± 1hr",
  "severity": "high",
  "witnesses": 5,
  "governance_approved": true,
  "consent_valid": true
}
```

Note: Enough for accountability, not enough for surveillance.

## Children's Privacy

### Enhanced Protections

```python
def protect_youth_participants(participant):
    if participant.age < 18:
        # Extra anonymization
        participant.data = deep_anonymize(participant.data)
        
        # Parental/community consent required
        require_guardian_consent(participant)
        
        # No direct contact
        participant.contact = community_liaison_only
        
        # Enhanced deletion rights
        participant.deletion = immediate_on_request
```

## Transparency Reports

### Published Quarterly

```yaml
transparency_metrics:
  - Total observations received
  - Aggregation statistics
  - Erasure requests processed
  - Threat incidents handled
  - Legal requests received/rejected
  - Community concerns addressed
```
