# TML Blockchain Governance

**Path**: `/governance/blockchain_governance.md`  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Architecture**: Mathematical Consensus, No Permission Required

---

## Executive Summary

TML governance operates through **mathematical consensus on immutable blockchains**, not institutional committees. This enables immediate deployment without coordination, automatic enforcement via smart contracts, tamper-proof evidence via cryptographic proofs, and recommended Stewardship Council enhancement for those who want it later.

---

## Core Governance Principles

### Mathematical Authority
- **Blockchain consensus** replaces institutional voting
- **Cryptographic proof** replaces committee approval
- **Smart contracts** replace policy committees
- **Immutable logs** replace meeting minutes

### Deployment Freedom
- Implementation via Docker without institutional coordination
- No approval process needed
- Full accountability from implementation

### Comprehensive Protection Scope
All governance covers:
1. **Human Discrimination** - Algorithmic bias protection
2. **Human Rights** - 26-document framework enforcement
3. **Earth Protection** - 20+ environmental treaties
4. **Future Generations** - Intergenerational justice

---

## Blockchain Governance Architecture

### Primary Governance Chains
```yaml
Bitcoin:
  role: "Ultimate authority anchor"
  finality: "~60 minutes"
  security: "Highest ($500B+ network value)"
  governance: "Proof of Work consensus"

Polygon:
  role: "Real-time enforcement"
  finality: "~3 seconds"
  throughput: "65,000 TPS"
  governance: "Proof of Stake consensus"

Ethereum:
  role: "Smart contract automation"
  finality: "~15 minutes"
  ecosystem: "Largest smart contract platform"
  governance: "Proof of Stake consensus"
```

### Consensus Requirements
- **Minimum 2 chains** must confirm for validity
- **No single chain** can override others
- **Mathematical proof** supersedes any human decision
- **Automatic enforcement** via smart contracts

---

## Sacred Zero Threshold Governance

### Threshold Definition Sources
**46+ Authoritative Documents**:
```yaml
Human Rights (26+ documents):
  - Universal Declaration of Human Rights
  - International Covenants (ICCPR, ICESCR)
  - Convention Against Torture
  - Geneva Conventions
  - Child Rights Convention
  - Disability Rights Convention
  - [Full list in /docs/mandates/human_rights/]

Earth Protection (20+ documents):
  - Paris Agreement
  - Convention on Biological Diversity
  - IPCC Reports
  - Planetary Boundaries Framework
  - Indigenous FPIC Protocols
  - [Full list in /docs/mandates/earth_protection/]
```

### Threshold Updates
**Automatic via Oracles**:
- Treaty changes detected automatically
- Scientific consensus updates pulled
- No committee approval needed
- Cryptographic proof of source

**Manual Override Protection**:
- Cannot weaken below international standards
- All changes logged immutably
- Liability for non-compliance automatic

---

## Investigation and Enforcement

### Blockchain-Based Investigation
**Evidence Access**:
- Anyone can verify logs via blockchain explorers
- Cryptographic proofs publicly available
- No permission needed to investigate
- Whistleblowers can act anonymously

**Evidence Properties**:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be altered after creation
- **Timestamped**: Precise chronology preserved
- **Attributable**: Cryptographically signed
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can validate

### Legal Enforcement
**Automatic Liability**:
```python
if not blockchain.has_valid_log(action_id):
    liability = "STRICT_LIABILITY"
    penalties = "MAXIMUM"
    criminal_charges = "NEGLIGENCE"
    executive_liability = "PERSONAL"
```

**No Committee Needed**:
- Courts read blockchain directly
- Evidence speaks for itself
- Missing logs = guilt presumption
- Smart contracts execute penalties

---

## Smart Contract Automation

### Penalty Execution
```solidity
contract TMLEnforcement {
    function checkCompliance(bytes32 actionId) public {
        if (!hasValidLog(actionId)) {
            // Automatic penalties
            transferPenalty(violator, amount);
            notifyAuthorities(violator);
            updatePublicRecord(violation);
        }
    }
}
```

### Victim Compensation
- **Automatic disbursement** from Memorial Fund
- **No committee approval** required
- **Smart contract triggers** based on evidence
- **Immediate support** for verified harm

---

        uint256 violationType
    ) public {
        // No committee review needed
        require(verifyEvidence(evidenceHash), "Invalid proof");
        
        // Calculate reward immediately
        uint256 penalty = calculatePenalty(violationType);
        uint256 communityReward = penalty * 15 / 100;
        
        // Pay community instantly
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(communityReward);
        
        emit ViolationReported(msg.sender, violationType, communityReward);
    }

## FILE 3: /performance/latency_metrics.md

```markdown
# Latency Metrics

This document defines latency measurement methods, performance classes, and verification procedures for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework. All metrics apply to production-grade deployments operating under real-time ethical decision workloads.

## 1. Purpose

To ensure accountability and responsiveness, TML establishes strict latency budgets for every component in the decisionâ€“logging pipeline. These values are continuously verified through automated benchmarks and external audit reports.

## 2. Measurement Scope

Latency is measured across two distinct domains:

- **Execution Path:** The primary AI decision loop. Target: No measurable delay from TML operations.

- **Accountability Path:** Sacred Zero evaluation, hashing, and blockchain anchoring. Target: Completion within 500 ms at P95 percentile.

## 3. Latency Classification

| Layer | Description | Target (ms) | Measurement Tool |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Decision Execution | Core AI inference and decision | â‰¤ 2 | Native instrumentation |
| Sacred Zero Trigger | Moral complexity detection and classification | â‰¤ 10 | TML internal profiler |
| Always Memory Write | Hash creation and local persistence | â‰¤ 100 | System-level I/O monitor |
| Log Sealing | Merkle batching and finalization | â‰¤ 250 | Batch validator |
| Blockchain Anchoring | External network confirmation | â‰¤ 500 | Multi-chain anchor verifier |

## 4. Verification Process

- **Sampling Rate:** Every 1,000th transaction is sampled for latency verification.
- **Aggregation:** Median, P95, and P99 metrics are recorded.
- **Reporting:** Monthly summary posted to the Integrity Monitoring system.
- **Alert Thresholds:** Any P95 breach > 20% triggers investigation by performance council.

## 5. Test Environments

| Environment | Description | Hardware Baseline | Operating Mode |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Local | Developer or academic setup | 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM | Single node |
| Cluster | Production or cloud setup | 32-core CPU, 128GB RAM | Multi-node parallel |
| Stewardship Council | Institutional replication layer | Variable | Multi-region distributed |

## 6. Benchmark Schedule

- **Automated Daily Runs:** Local and cluster environments.
- **Quarterly Reports:** Aggregated latency data published to `/protection/integrity-monitoring.md`.
- **Independent Validation:** Recommended third-party latency verification under Governance Council review.

## 7. Compliance

All latency data must remain reproducible and verifiable. Audit trails are retained for a minimum of five years, ensuring traceability of system performance across software revisions.
