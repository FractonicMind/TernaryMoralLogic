# **General FAQ**

## **Introduction**

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **universal accountability framework** for artificial intelligence, a constitutional layer for machines.

At its core lies **Always Memory**: **No memory \= No action.**

Every AI decision, trivial or profound, is preceded by an immutable, cryptographically sealed log. This transforms ethics from aspiration into **evidence**.

TML is not a commercial product. It is a **legacy project**, created by Lev Goukassian who, facing terminal illness, chose to dedicate his remaining time to building accountability infrastructure for humanity.

**Sacred Zero is exactly what's needed where lives and billions are on the line.**

## **Core Principles**

**Q1: What are the three states of TML?**

* **\+1 (Proceed)**: Routine, low-risk actions execute with minimal metadata

* **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Ethically complex actions trigger a deliberate act of reflection ‚Äî a log of reasoning, alternatives, and risks

* **\-1 (Refuse)**: Unsafe, malicious, or prohibited actions are blocked, with refusal logged

All three states receive identical logging treatment. The classification aids human investigation, not system behavior.

**Q2: What is Always Memory?**

Always Memory mandates that every AI action produces a cryptographically signed log before execution. This principle is absolute. Version 5.0 incorporates:

* **Asynchronous Attested Batching (AAB)** for realistic performance

* **Multi-TEE diversity** with Zero-TEE fallback

* **Two-tier Guardian architecture** for economic viability

* **Cryptographic erasure with attested shredding** for GDPR compliance

* **Sacred Zero circuit breaker** with policy-defined human oversight

* **Comprehensive residual risk mitigations** from external due diligence

**Q3: What exactly gets logged?**

Each batch log includes:

* Timestamp range (microsecond precision)

* Unique batch and action identifiers

* Input/output hashes for each action

* Model name, version, configuration hash

* Classification array (+1/0/-1)

* Hardware attestation quote (TEE-specific)

* Cryptographic signature (ephemeral HSM key)

* Proof-of-publication receipts

* Guardian confirmations (k-of-n threshold)

* Goukassian Promise elements

## **The Goukassian Promise**

**Q4: What is the Goukassian Promise?**

Three sacred commitments embedded in every TML implementation:

üî¶ **The Lantern**: Illuminates ethical paths ‚Äî systems demonstrate capacity for moral deliberation

‚úçÔ∏è **The Signature**: Creator's ORCID (0009-0006-5966-1243) cryptographically embedded in every log

üìú **The License**: Legal terms that protect proper use and punish misuse

These aren't decorative. They're functional commitments that bind the technology to its ethical purpose:

* Pause when truth is uncertain

* Refuse when harm is clear

* Proceed where truth is

---

## **The Hybrid Shield**

**Q5: What is the Hybrid Shield?**

TML ensures logs cannot be erased or falsified through dual armor:

**Layer 1 \- Institutional Shield**:

* Real-time replication to 11 independent institutions

* Geographic and jurisdictional diversity

* Rotating institutions prevent capture

**Layer 2 \- Mathematical Shield**:

* Daily root hashes to public blockchains

* Mathematical proof against tampering

* Permanent checkpoints even if Guardians collude

*Alter one byte? Hash breaks.*

---

## **Performance & Scalability**

**Q6: What is Asynchronous Attested Batching (AAB)?**

AAB improves performance by buffering actions inside TEEs and sealing them in batches:

* Amortizes TEE transition cost (\~17,000 cycles) across thousands of actions

* Reduces per-action overhead to \<1ms in high-throughput systems

* Enables tiered latency modes for different use cases

**Q7: What are the realistic latency profiles?**

**Standard Always Memory** (200-300ms):

* Use: Financial decisions, medical diagnostics

* Full distributed validation

**Priority Always Memory** (50-100ms):

* Use: Time-sensitive business logic

* Fee-based priority processing

**Emergency Always Memory** (30-45ms):

* Use: Autonomous braking, life-critical only

* Requires proof that Standard Always Memory causes harm

**Q8: How does Always Memory handle traffic spikes?**

* Adaptive batching intervals based on load

* Backpressure signaling (HTTP 429\)

* Priority fee-based queues

* Client-side reconciliation for in-flight transactions

* Graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure

## **Security Architecture**

**Q9: How does Multi-TEE Diversity protect the system?**

Mandatory heterogeneous infrastructure:

* 40% Intel SGX nodes

* 40% AMD SEV-SNP nodes

* 20% AWS Nitro Enclaves

* Side-channel attacks limited to single architecture

* **Time-locked vesting**: Genesis Partners cannot consolidate power immediately

* **Automated slashing**: Protocol-enforced penalties for provable misbehavior

* **Master Guardian Agreement**: Legal framework for disputes

* **Binding on-chain votes**: Major decisions require community consensus

* 30% minimum of penalties to victims

* 40% if victims include vulnerable populations

* Right to demand logs (missing \= automatic liability)

* Immediate emergency support for critical cases

* Lifetime support for permanent AI-caused disabilities

## **Sacred Zero & Accountability**

**Q24: What is Sacred Zero?**

A deliberate act of reflection: when an AI confronts moral ambiguity, it pauses, logs, and escalates. Not a gimmick, a conscience checkpoint.

Sacred Zero marks moments requiring special moral consideration. The name carries weight intentionally; when investigators see Sacred Zero in logs, they know to pay attention.

**Q25: How does the Sacred Zero circuit breaker work?**

1. **Pause**: Action halted upon Sacred Zero detection

2. **Request**: Authenticated confirmation sent to designated authority

3. **Window**: 500ms for human/policy response

4. **Resolution**: Explicit confirm executes; timeout aborts

5. **Log**: Complete decision chain recorded with policy hash

**Q26: How is alert fatigue prevented?**

* Dynamic rate-limiting: First 5 events/hour require review

* Subsequent similar events auto-blocked with cool-down

* Immutable policy attestation prevents blame-shifting

* Mandatory third-party audits tied to insurance premiums

* Accountability Council governance of trigger policies

* Immediate protocol-level ejection of affected types

* Zero-TEE emergency mode activation

* 80% BFT consensus required for operations

* Higher cost/latency but maintains continuity

**Q28: What if Guardians collude?**

* Stake-weighted selection makes it economically infeasible

* Random sharding prevents prediction

* Public audit logs ensure transparency

* Automated slashing for provable misbehavior

* Quadratic voting prevents capture

**Q29: What if the legal defense fund is exhausted?**

* Reinsurance policies cap single-case exposure

* Multiple funding sources ensure replenishment

* Emergency assessment mechanisms

* Foundation reserve requirements

## **Technical Specifications**

**Q30: Sample Always Memory v5.0 batch structure:**

## **Conclusion**

TML with **Always Memory** is not about perfection. It is something rarer:

* **Technically unassailable**: every known failure mode mapped, with mitigation.

* **Economically real**: costs acknowledged, scaled by liability.

* **Legally viable**: erasure, admissibility, and cross-border compliance addressed.

* **Moral**: Sacred Zero ensures machines carry conscience as well as code.

This is accountability with a Lantern:

* No log, no action.

* No Lantern, no trust.

**Always Memory** ensures that tomorrow‚Äôs machines carry both memory and humility, not as afterthought, but as foundation.

* **Immutable logs** that cannot be erased

* **Independent Guardianship** that cannot be captured

* **Hybrid Shield protection** that preserves evidence

* **Sacred Zero** as the conscience of machines

* **Whistleblower and victim safeguards** that ensure justice

This is **memory that power cannot erase, evidence that courts cannot dismiss, and conscience that machines cannot ignore.**

The Lantern shines beyond names. The framework outlives its creator. The promise endures.

**Sacred Zero is exactly what's needed where lives and billions are on the line.**
