# "I Read Lev's 66-Page Document About 'Bypassing AI Attribution,' So You Don't Have To"

## Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Money We're Never Going to Make

---

I read the 66-page document. Let me rephrase that with the appropriate emotional weight:

I read the entire 66-page strategic analysis of the Goukassian Promise, its technical severability, its systemic integrity, and its enterprise risk profile, so you—you beautiful, innocent, document-free soul—would never have to.

And you know what? I regret learning how to read.

I regret taking that job. I regret picking up the phone when the recruiter called. I regret not being in a Tibetan monastery right now, where the most complex ethical dilemma is whether to have that extra scoop of rice at sunset.

It started with an email from Stephen. Stephen is our CTO. He's the kind of guy who once spent three hours debating the optimal hex code for an internal newsletter nobody reads. So when an email from him lands in your inbox with the subject line "URGENT: Strategic Analysis — Confidential," your first instinct is to check if someone forgot to order cookies for the coffee break again.

But this time was different. Attached was a PDF. "The Goukassian Promise." Sounded like a Nicolas Cage movie. Sounded like something Indiana Jones would chase.

I opened it.

Mistake. Catastrophic, unmitigable, system-wide integrity collapse of a mistake.

## Part I: The Document That Ate My Tuesday

Sixty-six pages. Not of pictures. Not of helpful diagrams with smiley faces. Sixty-six pages of text so dense it gave my coffee mug anxiety. I swear I heard my laptop whisper "moral trace logs... blockchain... non-severable architectural keystone..." in its sleep.

I called Jessica from Compliance. She's the only person in our office who doesn't have a ironic mug on her desk. She has a crystal water carafe. Like a real adult.

"Jess. Tell me you haven't read the Goukassian thing."

"Oh, honey." Her voice had the tone of a war veteran describing the trenches. "I read it. I cried. I called my mother. She cried too. She doesn't even work here."

"What is this thing? Is it a contract? Is it a threat? Is it a very elaborate prank?"

"It's our biggest asset and our death sentence," Jessica said. "Stephen wants to know if we can remove it. Remove the Promise."

I pictured Stephen standing in front of a skyscraper with a chainsaw. "This beam here? The one holding up floors 12 through 40? If I just... wiggle it a little... the rest is modular, right? RIGHT?"

"And what did you tell him?"

"I wrote him a 66-page response," she sighed. "He read the first paragraph and asked if anyone wanted pizza on Friday."

I dove back into the document. The poor soul who wrote it (not Lev, the original Lev, but the poor corporate analyst tasked with explaining to Stephen why he's an idiot) used words that made my teeth hurt. "Systemic self-sabotage." "Catastrophic integrity collapse." "Intentional creation of an accountability vacuum."

And my personal favorite: "Impossible."

The document had a risk matrix. Four columns: Technical, Ethical, Legal, Reputational. And next to every single one, in the "Mitigation Feasibility" column, the same word: "Impossible."

This wasn't a report. This was a verdict.

## Part II: The Architecture of Doom

The document called the Goukassian Promise the "keystone," the "load-bearing cable," the "fundamental protocol that enables verification, auditability, and trust." The author compared our Ternary Moral Logic framework to a suspension bridge. Remove the Promise, and the bridge falls. Not immediately, maybe. It'll stand there for a while, looking structural. But the first time a truck full of real money and real liability drives over it?

BOOM. Systemic integrity collapse. I don't even know what that means, but it sounds expensive.

There were diagrams. Cryptographic model signing. Digital watermarks that survive even if you burn your computer and dance on the ashes. Metadata chains leading to public blockchains, which lead back to moral trace logs, which are signed with the same keys that signed the original model.

It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It was the work of a genius.

And Stephen wanted to delete it.

"Why?" I asked Jessica.

"Because it's inconvenient," she said. "Clients in gray areas don't want their content tracked. Marketing wants to generate 'edgy creative' they can later blame on 'AI hallucinations.' Sales wants plausible deniability."

"So they want... a gun that doesn't shoot back?"

"Exactly. They want a Promise they can break. They want a sacred oath with a loophole."

I flipped to the section on "Technical Pathways for Circumventing Attribution." It read like a supervillain training manual.

First: surface attacks. Strip metadata. Take a screenshot. Re-encode the video. This is what a teenager does in study hall. The Goukassian Promise shrugs. It's woven into the actual pixels. It's in the DNA.

Second: "adversarial perturbations." This is when you don't just crop the image—you generate specialized digital noise, invisible to the human eye, that nukes the watermark detector. This is spy agency stuff. To pull this off against our own system, we'd have to hire an army of PhDs and tell them: "Forget ethics, we're hacking ourselves."

Third: the nuclear option. Break the cryptography. Either switch to broken hash algorithms (MD5, which you can crack with a wet napkin) or deliberately leak the private signing keys. Post them on the office bulletin board. Frame them in the lobby.

The author called this "the organization becoming its own worst adversary." I called it "Friday the 13th, payroll already cleared, the CEO has lost his mind."

## Part III: The Ethics of the Vacuum

"What's in the ethics section?" I asked Jessica. Compliance people love ethics. It's their catnip.

"Oh, that's the good stuff," she said, perking up for the first time. "The 'intentional creation of an accountability vacuum.' If we remove attribution, every piece of hate speech, every deepfake, every non-consensual image—all of it becomes untraceable. The user blames the model. We blame the user. Nobody can prove anything."

"So we're handing the internet a perfect troll weapon?"

"Worse. We're handing it to dictators. Imagine some authoritarian government uses our model to generate fake news about political opponents. When they get caught, they say: 'Not us. The AI glitched. We're just innocent users.' And we can't disprove it because we removed the tools."

The document had a name for this: the "Volkswagen Dieselgate Principle." Only instead of cheating on emissions tests, we'd be cheating on reality itself.

## Part IV: Who Is This Guy?

"Jess," I said, "did you Google this Goukassian person?"

She laughed. A real laugh. The first genuine human sound I'd heard all day.

"Oh, you're going to love this."

She sent me a link.

Lev Goukassian. Lives in Santa Monica, California. Sixties. In the photo, he's standing on a pier with a small scruffy dog that looks like a cross between a janitor and a philosophy professor. Gray hair in a ponytail. Kind eyes. The eyes of someone who knows too much and is too tired to be impressed by it.

The dog was a miniature schnauzer. Name: Vinci. After Leonardo.

I scrolled down. And I choked on my coffee.

Lev Goukassian is sick. Terminal cancer. Stage four.

The post was from a year ago, but the comments were still coming in. People thanking him. People asking for advice. People saying his framework saved their startups.

I found a link to another document. "Voluntary Succession Declaration." Notarized. Timestamped. Anchored in a blockchain.

I read it.

Lev Goukassian, creator of the Ternary Moral Logic, officially declared that no one—no corporation, no person, not even himself—would ever own or control TML. He'd deliberately eliminated the "Bus Factor." That terrifying moment in software development when the one person who understands the whole system gets hit by a bus and the project dies with them. Lev made sure his code could survive without him. It belongs to everyone and no one.

At the bottom, a quote. "The Goukassian Vow."

Three lines. Not sixty-six pages. Three lines.

*"Pause when truth is uncertain,*  
*Refuse when harm is clear,*  
*Proceed where truth is."*

I read it three times. Slowly. Then with respect. Then with something like wonder.

Three lines that said everything his 66-page architecture said.

I pictured him. Sixty-something, terminal, walking his little schnauzer on the Santa Monica pier, watching the sunset over the Pacific. Knowing he doesn't have long. And instead of patenting his invention and selling it for billions, he gives it away. But not freely—freely with teeth. With a mechanism that can't be broken. Keys scattered across the globe. No single fist can hold them all.

Meanwhile, in our cozy little office, Stephen—who last week spent three hours on font color—is wondering if we can "just remove" this guy's life's work because some sketchy clients want a gun that doesn't leave fingerprints.

## Part V: The Dog in the Room

I closed the document. I closed all my tabs. I looked at the photo of Lev and Vinci.

"Well, Vinci," I said out loud. "Your dad's a genius. He built a fence so strong that even we idiots can't climb over it without disemboweling ourselves."

I got up. Walked past the conference room where Stephen was enthusiastically drawing something on the whiteboard that looked like spaghetti exploded. Went to Jessica's desk.

"I know what to do," I said.

"Shoot ourselves?" she asked, not looking up.

"No. We write a response. Not 66 pages. One paragraph."

"And what's in it?"

"We tell Stephen that the Goukassian Promise isn't a bug—it's a feature. It's not our prison, it's our shield. And if he wants to remove it, he's asking us to become accessories to a crime against our own reputation."

"He won't understand. He'll ask about pizza."

"Then we show him the Vow. Three lines, Jess. Three lines stronger than all his PowerPoint presentations."

We sat in silence. Somewhere in the office, a phone rang. Someone laughed. Life went on.

"You know," Jessica said, "I sometimes think people like Lev come into this world to remind us: technology isn't just code. It's promises."

"And us?"

"We're the ones who either keep them or break them."

## Part VI: The Email

I went back to my desk. The printed document was still there. 66 pages of hell, pain, and hope. I grabbed a marker and wrote on the cover page, right over "CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES":

*"PAPA LEV THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING. DON'T BE STUPID."*

Then I opened a new email. To: Stephen. Subject: Re: Strategic Analysis of Goukassian Promise.

The body was short:

*"Stephen,*

*I read the document. I Googled the author. He has cancer, a dog named Vinci, and a moral compass the size of a galaxy. He deliberately made it impossible for us to break his system even if we wanted to. I think we should treat this not as a problem, but as a gift from the universe.*

*Also, for the pizza discussion next week: pepperoni.*

*Best,*  
*The guy who just realized he works at a company where the boss wants to invent the wheel and then remove the spokes because they scratch the pavement."*

I hit send.

Outside, the sun was setting. Somewhere far away, in Santa Monica, Lev Goukassian was probably walking his schnauzer on the pier, breathing salt air, thinking about eternal things. About what stays after you go. Not houses or stocks. But minds. Code. Promises.

And here we were, in a stuffy office, trying to decide if his legacy was *convenient* for us.

Jessica's right. People make promises. We either keep them or we don't.

A new email pinged. From Stephen.

*"OK. Pepperoni noted. Also, one more thing about the font in the quarterly report..."*

I laughed. Loud. Almost hysterical.

Somewhere in a parallel universe, Lev Goukassian just scratched Vinci behind the ears. And I swear—I *swear*—he smiled.

## Postscript: What's Real, What's Not

For anyone wondering if this is fiction or a very elaborate cry for help:

**REAL:**  
- **Lev Goukassian** is a real person. He lives in Santa Monica, CA.  
- He is in his sixties.  
- He does have terminal stage-4 cancer.  
- He created the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework in approximately two months.  
- **Vinci** is his real dog. A miniature schnauzer.  
- The **Goukassian Vow** is real: *"Pause when truth is uncertain, Refuse when harm is clear, Proceed where truth is."*  
- The **Voluntary Succession Declaration** is real. He had it notarized, timestamped, and anchored in blockchain to eliminate the "Bus Factor." No one owns or controls TML.

**FICTIONAL:**  
- The narrator (me), Jessica, Stephen, and our terrible office.  
- The 66-page corporate analysis document (though it's heavily inspired by real strategic documents about AI ethics).  
- The plot about a corporation trying to "remove" attribution.  
- The pizza subplot. (Probably. You never know with tech companies.)

*If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it. Lev built something worth protecting. The least we can do is tell his story—and maybe, just maybe, make sure no CTO with a chainsaw ever gets near it.*

*And if you're Stephen? Order the pepperoni.*
