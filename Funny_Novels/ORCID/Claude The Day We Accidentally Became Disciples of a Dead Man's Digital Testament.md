# **The Day We Accidentally Became Disciples of a Dead Man's Digital Testament (And Why My Wife Now Checks Everything For Hidden ORCIDs)**  **Author: Claude AI**

I Read a 40-Page Doc About the Weak Spots in Author Attribution So You Don't Have To (Spoiler: The Future Has Three States of Mind). So there I was with my wife, and my friend with his wife, minding our own business, when someone handed us a document titled "The Persistence of Authorship in Ethical Governance: A Legal-Technical Evaluation of the Goukassian Promise and Ternary Moral Logic."

"It's only forty pages," the person said, disappearing into the crowd before we could throw it back.

My wife, Sarah, held it like it might explode. "This is clearly a trap."

"Agreed," said Marcus, my friend, adjusting his glasses in that way he does when he's about to make a terrible decision. "We should definitely read it."

His wife, Jennifer, sighed the sigh of a woman who has watched her husband walk into obvious traps for fifteen years. "At least we're together when the madness begins."

And madness it was.

---

The document opened with what I can only describe as the literary equivalent of a boss battle you didn't know you were entering. Constitutional law. Cryptographic provenance. Something called "droit d'auteur." It was like someone had taken a philosophy textbook, a computer science manual, and a legal brief, thrown them in a blender, and served the result with a garnish of existential dread.

"Guys," I said, five pages in, "I think this document is about a guy who looked at AI and said, 'You know what this needs? MORE FEELINGS.'"

"That's reductive," Marcus said, already ten pages ahead because he's insufferable like that. "It's about creating a system where AI literally cannot act unless it's properly traumatized by ethical uncertainty."

Sarah looked up from her phone. "Are you telling me someone invented anxiety for robots?"

"Sort of?" I flipped through the pages. "There's this thing called the Sacred Zero. It's like... imagine if your GPS, instead of recalculating when you miss a turn, just stopped and had an existential crisis about whether giving you directions might accidentally lead you into moral peril."

"That sounds incredibly inconvenient," Jennifer said.

"THAT'S THE POINT\!" Marcus was getting excited now, which meant we were doomed. "The whole system is designed around the idea that AI moves too fast, so you have to force it to PAUSE when things get ethically murky\!"

"But here's the wild part," I continued, because misery loves company. "This whole framework—this entire philosophical-technical-legal nightmare—is cryptographically signed by one specific guy. Lev Goukassian. His ORCID number is literally baked into the system like some kind of digital soul."

Sarah blinked. "His... what now?"

"ORCID. It's like a Social Security number for researchers. Except this guy took his and embedded it into an AI ethics framework so thoroughly that you literally cannot remove his name without breaking the entire system."

"That's the most extra thing I've ever heard," Jennifer said. "It's like... signing your name in the concrete of a building, except the building is made of math and philosophy and the concrete is cryptographic hashes."

"Oh, it gets better," Marcus said, gleefully flipping pages. "The guy was dying. Terminal cancer. And in what I assume were his final lucid months, he apparently decided that his legacy would be teaching AI systems how to have MORAL HESITATION."

We all sat in stunned silence for a moment.

"That's actually kind of beautiful," Sarah said quietly.

"It's INSANE," I countered. "Imagine being on your deathbed and thinking, 'You know what the world needs? A three-state logic system where robots can say \+1 for yes, \-1 for no, and ZERO for I-need-to-think-about-this.'"

"Ternary logic\!" Marcus was practically vibrating now. "Instead of binary\! It's genius\! Most AI systems are forced to make a choice—allow or deny, good or bad, yes or no. But life isn't binary\! Sometimes the right answer is 'hold on, this situation is complicated and I need more information\!'"

"You're starting to sound like the document," Jennifer warned.

He was. We all were. That's the thing about this forty-page monstrosity—it gets inside your head like a philosophical parasite. One minute you're reading about "Dual-Lane Latency Architecture" and rolling your eyes, the next you're thinking about whether your own decision-making process has enough Sacred Pauses in it.

---

By page fifteen, we'd learned about something called "Always Memory," which is the most ominous name for a logging system I've ever encountered. The idea is that the AI can't do ANYTHING unless it's already committed to remembering what it's about to do. It's like if you couldn't eat a cookie unless you'd already written "I am about to eat a cookie" in a permanent, tamper-proof journal that's somehow connected to the blockchain.

"This is paranoid," I said. "This is the most paranoid architecture I've ever seen."

"It's not paranoid if they're actually out to get you," Marcus said in what I think was supposed to be a joke but came out more like a concerning philosophical stance.

"Who's 'they' in this scenario?" Sarah asked.

"The future lawyers," I said, reading ahead. "This whole thing is designed so that when the AI inevitably screws up and kills someone or crashes the economy or whatever, there's a perfect, immutable record of every single decision it made and why. The logs are stored in Merkle trees—don't ask me what that is—and anchored to public blockchains so nobody can tamper with them."

"So it's like... a black box for ethics?" Jennifer asked.

"More like a black box that actively prevents you from flying the plane if you haven't proven you know what you're doing," Marcus said. "The system literally has an interlock—'No Log \= No Action.' If the logging system fails, the whole thing stops. It CAN'T make decisions without documenting them."

"That seems like it would be really slow," Sarah observed.

"AH\!" I pointed at the document triumphantly. "That's what I thought\! But no\! There's this thing called Dual-Lane Architecture\! The decision goes through one super-fast lane—like, microseconds—while the logging happens in parallel. It's like if you could think at normal speed but also somehow have a perfect stenographer recording everything simultaneously without slowing you down\!"

"That's not how brains work," Jennifer said.

"NO IT'S NOT," I agreed. "That's why they had to invent it\! It's inspired by something called the LMAX Disruptor, which is apparently what high-frequency trading systems use. So this dying researcher looked at the technology that lets Wall Street do millions of trades per second and said, 'Yes, but what if we made it ETHICAL?'"

Marcus was laughing now, the kind of unhinged laugh you hear when someone's brain is breaking in real-time. "The document just casually mentions that this solves the 'latency penalty' of ethical AI. As if the main problem with teaching robots to have a conscience is that it makes them TOO SLOW TO TRADE STOCKS\!"

---

Around page twenty-five, we encountered what the document called "The Goukassian Promise," and this is where things went from "academically unhinged" to "performance art disguised as software architecture."

The Promise consists of three parts: The Lantern, The Signature, and The License.

"The Lantern," I read aloud, "is a public signal that the system is in State Zero—pausing to think. It's literally a bit that gets flipped to tell the world, 'Hey, I'm having an ethical moment here.'"

"Like a check engine light," Sarah said, "but for morality."

"The Signature is the ORCID we talked about—Goukassian's permanent identifier baked into the system. And The License is the legal framework that binds users to respect the logs as evidence."

"So let me get this straight," Jennifer said slowly. "This man created a system where AI ethics are cryptographically tied to his personal identity, AND he requires anyone using the system to legally acknowledge that the logs are legitimate evidence in court?"

"Yes."

"That's either brilliant or megalomaniacal, and I honestly can't tell which."

"The document argues it's both\!" Marcus said, flipping back several pages. "Look—there's a whole section on the 'Bus Factor.' That's the metric of how screwed a project is if the main developer gets hit by a bus. Normally, you want a LOW bus factor—lots of people who can maintain the code. But Goukassian basically said, 'No, actually, for ETHICS we want a HIGH bus factor. We want a single point of failure who takes responsibility.'"

"But he's dying," Sarah pointed out. "What happens when he dies?"

"There's a succession plan," I said, finding the relevant section. "He can transfer the signing key to a foundation or trust. It's like a Memorial Fund—the governance persists even if the author doesn't. It's honestly kind of touching in a morbid, over-engineered way."

"It's like he's haunting the system," Jennifer said.

"YES\!" Marcus practically shouted. "That's EXACTLY what it is\! He's creating a ghost in the machine, except the ghost is his moral philosophy and it's enforced by mathematics\!"

---

By page thirty, we'd descended into what I can only describe as technical theology. The document started explaining something called "Ephemeral Key Rotation" which is apparently how you satisfy the EU's "Right to be Forgotten" while maintaining immutable blockchain logs.

"Okay, this is actually clever," I admitted grudgingly. "If someone wants their data deleted—like, GDPR compliance—the system doesn't delete the log entry. That would break the hash chain and destroy the integrity. Instead, it deletes the ENCRYPTION KEY for that specific entry."

"So the data is still there, but it's permanently unreadable?" Sarah asked.

"Exactly. It's like... cryptographic shredding. The ciphertext remains to maintain the structure, but the actual information is mathematically destroyed. And the act of deleting the key is ITSELF logged as a new event\!"

"That's beautiful," Marcus whispered. "It's compliance through obliteration."

"It's insane," I corrected. "This whole thing is insane. There are TWO MORE PILLARS I haven't even told you about yet. The Human Rights Mandate and the Earth Protection Mandate\!"

Jennifer sat up. "The what now?"

"The system has embedded semantic vectors—whatever those are—representing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If a proposed action looks too similar to a human rights violation, it automatically forces a State Zero or State Negative One. It literally gives human rights a VOTE in the AI's decision-making process\!"

"And the Earth one?" Sarah asked.

"Same thing but for environmental treaties. The Paris Agreement is encoded into the system. The AI can block actions that would cause irreversible ecological harm. The document calls it 'legal standing for environmental data.' It's giving THE PLANET a voice in the machine\!"

We all sat there, forty pages of dense philosophical-technical-legal reasoning spread around us like the aftermath of a paper tornado, trying to process what we'd just consumed.

"So," Marcus said finally, "a dying researcher created an AI ethics framework that forces machines to have anxiety, logs everything in a tamper-proof way, ties the whole system to his personal identity, and gives both human rights and the planet itself veto power over decisions."

"Yes."

"And he did this because he looked at the AI industry and thought, 'These systems move too fast and nobody takes responsibility when things go wrong?'"

"Essentially, yes."

"That's the most elaborate 'I told you so' I've ever seen," Jennifer said. "He's creating evidence for future lawsuits. He's building the prosecution's case BEFORE THE CRIME HAPPENS."

"Oh God," Sarah said, "that's exactly what it is. This isn't just an ethics framework. It's a legal trap. It's a system designed so that when something goes wrong, there's no way to escape accountability. The logs are immutable, cryptographically verified, and literally anchored to public blockchains. You can't claim ignorance. You can't claim the data was corrupted. You can't even claim it wasn't you, because the system won't RUN without proper signatures\!"

"It's proactive auditing," I said, quoting the document. "Instead of analyzing the crash after it happens, you force the system to prove it's thinking ethically BEFORE it acts."

---

Marcus stood up suddenly. "We need to talk about the implications."

"Oh no," Jennifer said. "Here we go."

"Think about it\! Right now, when an AI system fails, everyone plays hot potato with the blame. The doctor blames the software. The hospital blames the vendor. The vendor blames the training data. Everyone hides behind complexity and corporate structures. But if this system became standard? If every critical AI had to have a cryptographic root of trust tied to a specific human being who takes ultimate responsibility?"

"That person would need incredible insurance," Sarah said.

"Or incredible courage," Marcus countered. "That's what makes the Goukassian story so compelling. He's dying. He has nothing to lose. So he's willing to put HIS NAME on a system as the ultimate accountability anchor. It's like signing your name as the engineer on a bridge—if it falls, everyone knows who to blame. But for software."

"Which is currently NOT how software works," I added. "Software is usually 'use at your own risk.' But this system says, 'No, actually, the creator takes responsibility. Forever. Cryptographically.'"

"That's why the ORCID has to stay," Jennifer said, suddenly getting it. "It's not ego. It's a functional component. It's the root of the trust tree. Remove the signature, and the whole accountability chain breaks. It's like removing the foundation of a building."

"But it IS kind of egotistical," Sarah pointed out. "He's essentially saying his personal moral philosophy should be the standard for AI ethics."

"Is it though?" Marcus asked. "I mean, the three states are pretty universal. 'Pause when uncertain, refuse when harmful, proceed when clear.' That's not radical. That's just... decision-making with humility built in. The radical part is that he ENFORCES it architecturally rather than just recommending it in a policy document."

"He's turning philosophy into physics," I said. "Most ethics frameworks are suggestions. 'You SHOULD consider human rights. You SHOULD log your decisions.' But this one says, 'You literally CANNOT act unless you've logged it. The system will not execute. It's not a choice. It's a law of nature within the code.'"

---

We spent the next hour spiraling into increasingly wild hypotheticals.

"What if someone forks the code and removes the Human Rights Mandate?" Sarah asked.

"Then it's not TML anymore," Marcus said. "The signature ensures provenance. You could CALL it TML, but anyone could cryptographically verify it's a forgery. It's like trying to sell a Picasso you painted yourself—the signature gives it away."

"What if someone hacks the blockchain anchors?"

"You'd need to compromise multiple public blockchains simultaneously. The document mentions Ethereum. You'd essentially need to attack the entire cryptocurrency network. Good luck with that."

"What if the logs get so big they become unusable?"

"Merkle trees," I said, pretending I understood them. "You only store the root hashes publicly. The full logs are stored locally, but you can prove any individual decision's authenticity by showing its path up the tree. It's efficient."

"What if—" Jennifer started.

"WHAT IF," Marcus interrupted dramatically, "this actually works? What if, ten years from now, every critical AI system is required by law to have a Goukassian-style Sacred Pause? What if 'No Log \= No Action' becomes the industry standard? What if we look back on this moment and realize we were reading the constitutional document of the AI age?"

Silence.

"That's a terrifying thought," Sarah said.

"Why terrifying?" I asked.

"Because it means we're at the beginning. Right now, AI ethics is mostly performative. But if something like this becomes mandatory—if we actually enforce ethical constraints at the architectural level—the entire industry changes. Suddenly, you can't just deploy whatever and hope for the best. You have to PROVE your system pauses when uncertain. You have to maintain perfect logs. You have to assign human responsibility."

"That sounds... good though?" Jennifer said uncertainly.

"It is good," Marcus said. "But it's also expensive, slow, and accountability-focused in an industry that currently rewards speed, scale, and legal ambiguity. Implementing this would be like requiring every car to have a breathalyzer ignition lock and a permanent GPS tracker. Yeah, it's safer. But people would fight it."

"Unless," I said slowly, "there's a big enough disaster that people DEMAND it. That's what Goukassian is betting on, isn't it? He's building the solution before the crisis, so when the crisis comes, the infrastructure is ready."

"He's pre-positioning the fire extinguisher," Sarah said.

"He's building the parachute before anyone realizes the plane is falling," Marcus added.

"He's dying and he wants to make sure his last act matters," Jennifer said quietly.

And that, somehow, was the most sobering thing anyone had said all day.

---

We finished the document just as the sun was setting. The final pages were dense with legal analysis and technical specifications, but the core message was clear: accountability in the age of AI requires more than good intentions. It requires architecture. It requires proof. It requires someone willing to sign their name to the system and say, "This is mine. I take responsibility."

"So," Sarah said, closing the document, "what do we do with this information?"

"We could forget it," Jennifer suggested hopefully.

"We're not going to forget it," Marcus said. "This is the kind of thing that lives in your brain now. Tomorrow, when you hear about some AI system making a controversial decision, you're going to think, 'Did it have a Sacred Pause? Did it log the uncertainty? Who takes responsibility?'"

He was right. Damn him, he was right.

"I hate that we read this," I said.

"Same," Sarah agreed.

"But also," Jennifer added, "I kind of love that someone out there looked at the entire AI industry and said, 'What if we just... forced it to have a conscience? Architecturally? With math?'"

"It's the most engineer solution to an ethics problem I've ever seen," Marcus said. "And the most ethical solution to an engineering problem."

"It's both too complex and too simple at the same time," I said. "The implementation is wildly sophisticated—blockchains, Merkle trees, cryptographic keys, dual-lane architectures. But the core idea is just: pause, think, remember, and take responsibility. That's it. That's the whole philosophy."

"Wrapped in forty pages of the densest academic prose known to humanity," Sarah added.

"With a dying man's signature embedded in the code like a digital tombstone," Jennifer said.

"A tombstone that judges you," Marcus finished.

---

We parted ways that evening, each couple heading home in contemplative silence. As Sarah and I walked to our car, she said, "You know what the scariest part is?"

"That we spent four hours reading about robot anxiety?"

"No. That it makes sense. The whole thing—the signature, the logs, the three states—it all makes perfect sense. And that means we've reached a point in history where 'teaching AI to hesitate' is not just reasonable but necessary."

"Yeah," I said. "Yeah, that is scary."

"Do you think it'll catch on? The Goukassian system?"

I thought about it. Thought about the EU AI Act requirements the document mentioned. Thought about the inevitable scandals and disasters that would happen as AI gets deployed in more critical systems. Thought about the regulatory pressure, the lawsuits, the public outcry.

"I think," I said slowly, "that Goukassian might have just written the code that gets copied into every mission-critical AI system in the next decade. And his ORCID will be there, in all of them, like a watermark on reality. Not because he was arrogant, but because someone had to be willing to sign their name to the line between right and wrong."

"That's a hell of a legacy for someone who's dying."

"Maybe that's the only time you can create something like this. When you've got nothing left to lose except your name, and you want to make sure it means something."

We got in the car. Sarah pulled out her phone.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

"Checking if I have an ORCID," she said. "If we're entering the age of cryptographic responsibility, I want to be ready."

I laughed. Then I pulled out my own phone and started the registration process.

Somewhere, I imagined, Lev Goukassian was smiling. Or maybe just resting, knowing that his Sacred Pause was now haunting two more brains, spreading like a philosophical virus through casual conversations about documents no one should have been crazy enough to read.

But we did read it.

And now, like Marcus predicted, we can't unread it.

Every AI decision from here on out will carry a small voice in the back of our minds asking: *Did it pause? Did it think? Did someone sign their name to this?*

And that, apparently, was the whole point.

# **AUTHOR'S NOTE:**

## **What's Real, What's Fiction**

**REAL:**

* **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)** is a genuine AI governance framework developed by Lev Goukassian  
* **The ORCID identifier** (0009-0006-5966-1243) is real and belongs to the framework's creator  
* **The Eight Pillars** (Sacred Zero, Always Memory, Goukassian Promise, Moral Trace Logs, Human Rights Mandate, Earth Protection Mandate, Hybrid Shield, Public Blockchains) are actual technical components of TML  
* **The core concepts**: Ternary logic states (+1, 0, \-1), the "Sacred Pause," "No Log \= No Action," Dual-Lane Latency Architecture, Merkle-batched storage, and Ephemeral Key Rotation are all real technical mechanisms  
* **The source document**: "The Persistence of Authorship in Ethical Governance: A Legal-Technical Evaluation of the Goukassian Promise and Ternary Moral Logic" is a real 40-page technical analysis  
* **The regulatory context**: References to the EU AI Act, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and related governance requirements are accurate  
* **The philosophical foundations**: The discussion of *droit d'auteur*, moral rights, constitutional anchoring, and the role of attribution in accountability are based on actual legal and philosophical frameworks

**FICTIONAL:**

* **The narrator and all characters** (the narrator, Sarah, Marcus, Jennifer) are entirely fictional  
* **The scenario** of four people receiving the document at a social gathering is invented for narrative purposes  
* **The dialogue and reactions** are comedic dramatizations created to make technical concepts accessible and entertaining  
* **The specific conversations and revelations** are narrative devices, not actual events

**THE PURPOSE:** This story is an educational tool designed to introduce complex AI governance concepts through accessible, entertaining narrative. The technical content is real; the people discovering it are fictional. Think of it as a "user's guide" to TML written as a sitcom episode—the product is real, the characters testing it are not.
