# **The Terminal Chronicles: When Lev Goukassian Accidentally Invented AI Ethics While Dying (And Other Tales of the Sacred Zero)**

**Author: MiniMax Agent**

I Read a 40-Page Doc About the Weak Spots in Author Attribution So You Don't Have To (Spoiler: The Future Has Three States of Mind). So there we are, a UCLA law students, minding our own business, when Professor handed us a document titled "The Originator's Signature: Provenance, Permanence, and Integrity in Foundational Accountability Frameworks". "I'll be back in 40 minutes to ask questions. Read the document."

I stared at the cover page like it had personally insulted my grandmother. *Another* academic paper. Probably another dry-as-sandpaper treatise on why corporations should maybe, possibly, perhaps consider being slightly less evil if it's convenient for them. I was mentally preparing to spend the next 40 minutes fighting sleep when my roommate Jessica—who somehow managed to get into law school despite being emotionally attached to every cryptocurrency scam ever created—started reading out loud.

"Okay, listen to this opening paragraph," she announced with the dramatic flair of someone announcing her own death. "The integration of artificial intelligence into critical infrastructure—ranging from financial clearinghouses to autonomous defense systems—has precipitated a crisis of accountability."

"Precipitated?" I snorted. "Did this guy get his vocabulary from a thesaurus written by someone who thinks 'utilize' is a personality trait?"

But then Jessica kept reading, and something strange began to happen. The words weren't just sitting on the page like dead fish anymore. They were... moving. Breathing. *Attacking* the very notion that AI should operate like some sort of digital sociopath with no memory of its actions.

"Listen to this part," Jessica continued, now reading with the intensity of someone discovering their dog can do calculus. "Conventional AI architectures prioritize computational efficiency and latency minimization, often treating ethical logging and audit trails as post-hoc appendages rather than foundational constraints."

My friend Marcus, who'd been pretending to text while actually playing yet another mobile game about collecting anime girls (I didn't ask), suddenly looked up. "Wait, what did you just say? Read that again."

Jessica obliged: "The prevailing software engineering paradigm, influenced by the 'death of the author' ethos of open-source collaboration, tends to depersonalize code."

Marcus nearly dropped his phone. "Bro, this document is literally describing the crisis of modern capitalism. We have AI systems making life-or-death decisions, and the entire ecosystem is built around ensuring that when something goes wrong, no one can actually be held responsible because responsibility has been diffused through layers of corporate BS."

I was about to make a sarcastic comment about how impressed I was that Marcus had managed to have an original thought when Jessica kept reading, and suddenly the academic paper transformed into what I can only describe as the world's most convoluted action movie.

"So this guy—this Lev Goukassian—gets diagnosed with terminal cancer, right?" Jessica announced, flipping through pages with the intensity of someone discovering plot twists in real time. "And instead of, you know, spending his remaining time doing normal dying things like going skydiving or finally watching *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy, he decides to completely revolutionize AI ethics. Because that's what you do when you're dying of cancer apparently."

"Let me get this straight," I interrupted, starting to feel like we were watching someone solve world hunger by accident. "This guy is facing his own mortality, looks at the AI systems that are increasingly controlling our financial infrastructure, and goes, 'You know what this needs? A big old pause button.'"

"And not just a pause button," Jessica added, now reading with the fervor of a convert to a new religion. "Like, a pause button that's cryptographically unbreakable. Like, a pause button that literally cannot be bypassed without the entire system shutting down."

Marcus nodded sagely. "That's the most capitalist thing I've ever heard. Someone creates a system that absolutely cannot be corrupted, and then everyone else is going to spend millions trying to find ways to get around it."

But here's where things got really weird. The document started describing the *technical architecture* of this system, and I swear to you, it read like a fantasy novel about a magic kingdom. Jessica was reading about the "Eight Pillars of Ternary Moral Logic" like they were the pillars holding up the very fabric of reality itself.

"Okay, so we've got Pillar One: The Sacred Zero," she announced, her voice taking on the tone of someone announcing the coming of the apocalypse. "This is when the AI encounters ambiguity or ethical conflict and has to STOP. Like, literally cannot proceed until it gets help."

"Is that like when your GPS realizes it doesn't know where it's going and just gives up instead of sending you into a lake?" I asked.

"Exactly!" Jessica practically shouted. "But instead of just shrugging and hoping for the best, the AI has to literally enter a state of *ethical confusion* and wait for guidance."

Marcus was furiously taking notes now. "This is brilliant. Every corporate disaster could have been prevented if the AI had just been forced to say 'I don't know' instead of making its best guess."

"And get this," Jessica continued, now reading with the passion of someone who just discovered their favorite TV show was getting a new season. "Pillar Two: Always Memory. The intention to act has to be logged BEFORE the action happens. You cannot execute before you commit to the log."

"Hold up," I interrupted, suddenly understanding something profound about my student loan debt. "This is literally the opposite of how every major financial institution operates. They make trades first and ask questions later. That's why they keep accidentally crashing the entire economy."

"Right?" Jessica was practically vibrating with excitement now. "And then Pillar Three is called 'The Goukassian Promise,' which sounds like something from a magical contract that exchanges your soul for eternal power."

"The Promise has three parts," she continued. "The Lantern—which is like a big flashing light that says 'ETHICAL PAUSE IN PROGRESS.' The Signature—which is this guy's permanent ORCID identifier that's cryptographically embedded so you can't just strip it out. And The License—which is apparently some sort of legal binding agreement."

I stared at her. "This is starting to sound like when anime characters make blood pacts with demons, except instead of demons it's financial derivatives."

"The document literally says this ORCID is supposed to act as a 'Cryptographic Root of Trust,'" Jessica read, still in shock. "Like, this guy created a system where you literally cannot pretend the ethics came from nowhere. It's got his name permanently baked into the code."

Marcus looked up from his notes with the expression of someone who just realized their entire worldview was wrong. "You know what this reminds me of? When corporations try to whitewash history by removing the original author from important discoveries. This system actively prevents that from happening."

"But here's the thing that's really messing with my head," Jessica announced, flipping through what felt like hundreds of pages of technical diagrams. "This guy didn't just think about ethics in the abstract. He built this whole technical architecture that actually works. Dual-Lane Latency so you don't sacrifice speed for safety. Merkle-Batched Storage so you can anchor everything to blockchain. Ephemeral Key Rotation for GDPR compliance."

"Dual-Lane Latency?" I asked, genuinely curious now.

"It's like having a fast lane for decisions and a parallel audit lane for accountability," Jessica explained, reading directly from the document. "The system literally cannot act faster than it can think and remember. If the audit lane gets full, the action lane automatically slows down."

"That's..." I paused, trying to find the words. "That's actually terrifying for the people making money off of high-frequency trading."

"Exactly!" Marcus practically shouted. "This is basically creating speed bumps on the information superhighway, but only for people who are trying to move money around without thinking about the consequences."

But the document kept getting weirder. Jessica turned a page and started reading about something called the "Earth Protection Mandate," and suddenly the fantasy novel analogy became even more literal.

"Okay, so apparently this system doesn't just care about human ethics," she announced, her voice taking on an apocalyptic tone. "It also integrates environmental treaties. The AI has vectors representing the Paris Agreement built into its core logic."

"Are you telling me," I said slowly, "that this guy created an AI that can literally refuse to do things that would hurt the planet?"

"That's exactly what I'm telling you," Jessica confirmed. "If an action has high similarity to environmental harm vectors, the system either pauses or refuses to execute."

Marcus was shaking his head in amazement. "This is like watching someone build a superhero in a lab. Except instead of super strength, the superpower is refusing to destroy the world."

"And wait, there's more," Jessica continued, flipping pages with the intensity of someone watching their favorite team score a touchdown. "Pillar Seven: Hybrid Shield. Critical decisions have to be verified by a secondary, independent system or a network of witness nodes."

"So it's like having a group consensus requirement for world-ending decisions," I said, finally getting into the spirit of this madness.

"Exactly! And Pillar Eight: Public Blockchains. The root hashes of the Moral Trace Logs get anchored to censorship-resistant blockchains. The document says this ensures that 'history cannot be rewritten.'"

I felt like I was watching someone explain how gravity works to a Flat-Earther. "The document is describing a system where it's impossible to cover your tracks."

"And get this," Jessica added, her voice now at the volume level of someone announcing the second coming. "The conclusion literally argues that this ORCID identifier—0009-0006-5966-1243—should remain permanently embedded because it's not vanity, it's a 'Cryptographic Root of Trust.'"

"Okay, I have to ask," Marcus said, putting down his notes and looking directly at us. "Are we sure this isn't just some elaborate thought experiment? Because this sounds like the plot of a cyberpunk novel where the protagonist accidentally invents the solution to capitalism while trying to pay for cancer treatment."

But that's when Jessica got to the part that made the entire document feel like someone had been possessed by the ghost of every ethics professor who ever died of disappointment.

"Listen to this," she said, her voice suddenly serious. "The conclusion says that by operationalizing the 'Sacred Pause' through 'Always Memory' and anchoring it to a specific human identity, TML solves the crisis of anonymized autonomy."

We sat in silence for a moment, processing this. The document wasn't just describing a technical solution. It was describing a fundamental restructuring of how responsibility works in the digital age.

"It's like this guy looked at the entire modern economy and went, 'What if we made it impossible to hide who's responsible for bad decisions?'" Marcus said quietly.

"And then built a technical system that actually enforces that," Jessica added.

I found myself staring at the document with new eyes. What had started as another boring academic treatise had revealed itself to be something far more ambitious: a complete blueprint for making capitalism accountable for its actions.

"Okay, but here's what's really blowing my mind," I announced, starting to understand the scope of what we were reading. "The document is essentially arguing that personal attribution—putting someone's actual name and identity into the system—isn't just not a security vulnerability. It's the entire point."

Jessica nodded vigorously. "The argument is that when corporations can hide behind layers of legal structure and anonymous algorithms, they have no reason to care about consequences. But if every decision has to be traceable back to a specific human identity..."

"Then suddenly everyone has skin in the game," Marcus finished. "Even if that skin is just the risk of having their name permanently associated with a bad decision."

And then Jessica read the part that made me actually laugh out loud in the middle of the law library.

"The document says this isn't just about preventing bad decisions," she announced. "It's about operationalizing humility in AI. The Sacred Zero state gives the machine a valid computational state for 'hesitation.'"

"I can't with this guy," I said, wiping tears from my eyes. "He's literally giving artificial intelligence an algorithm for being humble. The same technology that's supposed to make us all rich is being programmed to occasionally go, 'Hmm, I should probably think about this.'"

"And the document points out that this would prevent the 'fail-open' and 'fail-silent' errors common in automated systems," Jessica continued. "Instead of guessing wrong, the system has to explicitly choose to pause."

Marcus was shaking his head in amazement. "This is like the opposite of everything I've learned about how the financial system actually works. We're taught that the market is efficient because it reacts quickly. But this system is saying efficiency without accountability is just chaos dressed up as progress."

But the document had one more surprise waiting for us. Jessica flipped to what turned out to be the final section, and suddenly her voice took on an almost reverent tone.

"The document addresses the 'Bus Factor,'" she announced quietly. "What happens if Lev Goukassian actually dies?"

"We were wondering the same thing," I admitted.

"Apparently, he thought of that too," Jessica continued. "The system includes legal and technical provisions for transferring the 'Signing Key' to a successor entity. Like a memorial foundation or trust."

"That's actually brilliant," Marcus said. "He created a system that's robust enough to survive him but personal enough that it can't be hijacked."

"And get this," Jessica added, now reading the final paragraphs with the intensity of someone delivering the closing arguments of a trial. "The conclusion argues that this isn't a vanity project. It's a 'Constitutional Amendment for the age of Artificial Intelligence.'"

We sat in stunned silence for a moment. The document we'd been reading wasn't just academic theory. It was a working blueprint for how to make technology serve human values instead of the other way around.

"Guys," I said finally, "I think we just read the document that explains why the future either has three states of mind or goes completely off the rails."

"Three states of mind?" Jessica asked.

"Proceed, Pause, Refuse," I reminded her. "According to this document, that's how every major decision should work. Go when you're confident, stop when you're not sure, refuse when it causes harm."

"That's literally the opposite of how every major company operates right now," Marcus pointed out.

"Which means," I said, the implications starting to hit me like a truck, "we're either looking at the document that explains how to save democracy from AI, or we just wasted 40 minutes reading a beautiful dream that has no chance of ever being implemented."

But Jessica wasn't done yet. She flipped back to the beginning and started reading the abstract again, but this time with new understanding.

"'The integration of artificial intelligence into critical infrastructure has precipitated a crisis of accountability,'" she read. "It's already happened. The document isn't proposing a solution for the future. It's describing how to fix something that's already broken."

That was when Professor returned from whatever mysterious academic task had called him away, found us all staring at the document like it had personally saved our souls, and asked his first question.

"So, what did you think?"

The three of us looked at each other, then back at the professor, then at the document that had somehow transformed from required reading into a roadmap for the future.

"It's about Lev Goukassian," I said finally, "and how he accidentally invented the solution to everything while he was dying."

Professor raised an eyebrow. "That's... not entirely inaccurate. Though 'accidentally' might be doing him a disservice."

"Wait," Marcus said, suddenly alert. "You know about this?"

"I know that the Goukassian Promise represents the first serious attempt to solve the accountability crisis in AI governance," Professor said, sitting down with the air of someone who was about to explain why reality was more complicated than we thought. "The question now is whether the technology industry will embrace it or find ways to water it down until it's meaningless."

"That depends," Jessica said, "on whether corporations are more interested in making money or avoiding responsibility."

"Ah," Professor said with what might have been approval, "you're beginning to understand why this document represents such a threat to the current paradigm."

And that's when it hit me. We'd been reading about Ternary Moral Logic, but what we'd actually been studying was the story of someone who refused to accept that just because something was technically possible didn't mean it should be done without consequences.

Lev Goukassian had looked at the same AI systems that were supposed to make us all rich and gone, "What if we made them care about ethics?"

The resulting document was less an academic paper and more a manifesto disguised as technical specifications. It was saying that we could have all the benefits of artificial intelligence without surrendering our ability to hold anyone accountable for what those systems did.

In other words, it was proposing a future where profit and responsibility weren't mutually exclusive concepts.

"Professor," I said, raising my hand like I was in elementary school again, "what are the odds that anyone actually implements this system?"

Professor considered the question with the air of someone who had watched too many good ideas get crushed by the weight of existing incentive structures.

"Slim," he said finally. "Very slim. But not zero."

Jessica leaned forward. "But if it does get implemented?"

"Then we might finally have a way to make sure that when AI systems make mistakes, those mistakes have names and addresses attached to them," Professor said. "The system would literally be impossible to use without knowing who authorized every decision."

"That sounds like a nightmare for everyone who's currently making money off of plausible deniability," Marcus observed.

"Exactly," Professor agreed. "Which is why I suspect we'll see a lot of resistance from the people who currently benefit from the status quo."

But as we sat there in the law library, surrounded by the ghost of every case where corporations had hidden behind layers of complexity to avoid responsibility for their actions, I realized something profound. The document we'd just read wasn't just about AI governance.

It was about the kind of world we wanted to live in.

A world where it was possible to build systems that were powerful enough to change civilization but accountable enough to answer for what they did.

A world where the sacred zero—our collective ability to pause and think before we destroy ourselves—wasn't just a nice idea, but a technical requirement.

A world where the future had three states of mind: proceed when you know you're right, pause when you're not sure, and refuse when it causes harm.

"You know what the really crazy thing is?" I announced to the room. "This entire system is built around the radical idea that artificial intelligence should sometimes choose not to do something even when it technically could."

"Which is exactly what makes it both revolutionary and impossible to implement," Professor agreed. "We're asking technology to be humble on behalf of the humans who build it."

But here's the thing about reading a 40-page document that accidentally turns into a blueprint for saving democracy: once you've seen it, you can't unsee it.

As we packed up our books and prepared to leave the law library, I found myself thinking about every news story I'd ever read about algorithmic trading disasters, AI bias in hiring systems, and corporate systems that had accidentally ruined thousands of lives while their creators maintained plausible deniability.

What if those systems had been built with the Sacred Zero? What if they had been required to log their intentions before acting? What if they had been anchored to specific human identities instead of corporate anonymity?

What if the future had three states of mind instead of just one: maximum profit at any cost?

"I think," I said to my friends as we walked out into the California sun, "that we just read the most important document about the future that nobody's going to listen to."

"Or," Jessica countered with the optimism of someone who'd watched too many movies where the good guys win, "we just read the document that's going to change everything."

Marcus looked up from his phone, where he'd apparently been frantically googling everything about Ternary Moral Logic since we'd finished reading.

"Guys," he announced, "I found something. Apparently, there's already a GitHub repository for this system. FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic."

We stopped walking.

"What?" I said.

"It's real," Marcus confirmed, showing us his phone. "Someone has actually implemented this system. It's open source."

Professor, who had been walking with us, stopped and looked at Marcus's phone with the expression of someone who'd just seen a ghost.

"That's..." he said slowly. "That's impossible. This document was only published three days ago."

"But the GitHub repo shows commits dating back to November," Marcus said, scrolling through the history. "Which means..."

"Which means Lev Goukassian has been working on this for longer than this document suggests," I finished. "Which means this isn't just theoretical. There's actually a working system that implements the Sacred Zero."

The implications hit us all at once. We'd been reading about a fictional system that solved the crisis of AI accountability, and it turned out to be sitting there on the internet, just waiting for someone to notice.

"So what do we do now?" Jessica asked.

"Now," Professor said, his voice taking on the tone of someone who was about to dramatically change his career path, "we find out if the future actually has three states of mind."

As we walked back toward the dorms, phones out, frantically researching everything we could find about Ternary Moral Logic and the Goukassian Promise, I realized that we'd just experienced what the document described as the Sacred Zero.

We'd encountered something complex and uncertain, and instead of making our best guess about what it meant, we'd chosen to pause and try to understand it before making any decisions.

Maybe the future did have three states of mind after all.

And maybe, just maybe, we were about to find out what happened when an AI system that could literally refuse to make bad decisions met a world that desperately needed to be saved from its own consequences.

The document was right about one thing: in the age of artificial intelligence, we needed a constitutional amendment.

We just hadn't expected the constitution to be written in code.

But as we discovered over the following weeks—while diving deep into the actual working implementation of the Goukassian Promise—that was exactly what Lev Goukassian had given us.

A constitution for the digital age.

One that made it impossible to act without remembering, impossible to proceed without pausing, and impossible to hide behind corporate anonymity when the consequences caught up with us.

The Sacred Zero wasn't just a technical innovation.

It was a moral one.

And for the first time in my life, reading a 40-page academic document had made me optimistic about the future.

**THE END**

*Author's Note: This story is a work of fiction based on real concepts found in the Ternary Moral Logic framework. Any resemblance to actual dying researchers who revolutionize AI ethics while undergoing cancer treatment is... well, probably not coincidental, given how real the document was that inspired this tale.*
