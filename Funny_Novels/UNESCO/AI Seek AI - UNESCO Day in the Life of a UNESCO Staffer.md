**AUTHOR'S NOTE:**    
This is a fictional story, but the implementation problem is real. The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021) is real, adopted unanimously by 194 countries. And Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is real—a verifiable, machine-auditable framework created by independent researcher Lev Goukassian to fill the missing operational layer that global ethics frameworks lack.

# **An Unexpected Email: A Day in the Life of a UNESCO Staffer**

## The Confident Morning

Ah, Paris. The city of lights, croissants, and bureaucratic meetings that stretch on longer than an Eiffel Tower queue. As the in-house lead on the UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation, I was riding high on the success of our groundbreaking 2021 adoption. My coffee, freshly brewed and delicately balanced in my oversized UNESCO mug, was frothy with triumph. I couldn’t help but feel a tad smug.

It had been a grueling process—a tedious diplomatic ballet with 194 member states twirling in and out of agreement—but we did it. *Our* Recommendation establishing the first global standard for AI ethics was complete! “Complete,” I muttered under my breath, stirring my coffee like it was some magic potion. It was “exceptionally applicable” and “visionary”! Each word was gilded in golden optimism.

The sun shone through my office window, giving my desk that perfect Instagram glow. I could practically hear the applause of technologists, ethicists, and regulators echoing through the corridors. I imagined confetti raining from the ceilings of the United Nations—only the finest, glittering in the light like my advanced visions of humanity thriving alongside intelligent machines.

As I reclined back in my ergonomic chair (thank you, UNESCO health benefits), I pondered how best to send our lofty ideals out into the world. An email? A press release? A huge, celebratory video featuring dancing robots? The options were limitless!

But just as I was about to get lost in this delightful daydream, my computer dinged. The bright alert drew my attention away from my fantasizing, and my brow furrowed at the unfamiliar yet intriguingly ominous email subject line: 

**“TML × UNESCO: The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down.”**

My initial response was slight annoyance. “Who on Earth is this ‘Goukassian’ character telling UNESCO how to ethically regulate AI?” I scoffed. I took a deep breath and clicked open the email. The moment I started skimming, my initial indifference quickly metamorphosed into curiosity, and then a tidal wave of panic washed over me.

## The Email of Doom

As I read Lev Goukassian’s email in full, I was torn between disbelief and admiration. Ternary Moral Logic—what in the world? It presented a chillingly compelling argument that we had left a crucial *“how”* completely unaddressed in our glorious Recommendation. The email frantically pointed out how our noble principles of “human oversight” and “accountability” were floating around in the ether, like loose balloons at a birthday party—colorful, cheerful, and utterly unanchored.

With every line I read, my mind screamed: *What have I done?!*

> “TML introduces a mandatory pause—a ‘Sacred Pause’—when AI encounters ethical ambiguity,” I read aloud, aghast, as if the simple words were searing my very soul. This was not merely theory; it was something concrete, enforceable! How was it possible that my entire vision rested on something akin to *vapor*? 

I sank lower in my chair, my coffee suddenly tasting bitterer than the unfiltered opinions of a crowded committee. This guy had the audacity to detail how we could have something—*real* oversight—rather than relying on the whims of some algorithm fed by vaguely defined human values.

How foolish I must have seemed, basking in the glow of a successful launch while simultaneously dodging the critical realities addressed by this obscure independent researcher. 

I moved on to the next point, my stomach performing somersaults: *Immutable Moral Trace Logs.* “These would turn our transparency PR claims into verifiable documentation!” I shouted at myself internally, suddenly parched as I slammed my empty mug down on the desk. If only I’d paid more attention to the specifics when drafting our resolution! 

How could we have neglected the very essence of what it meant to have *verifiable*, machine-readable ethics? I jotted down ideas of how Goukassian's framework would have implemented our lofty ideals instead of using them as wall adornments. Here it was—the suggestion that these ‘logs’ would provide court-admissible evidence for ethically consequential decisions.

That sweet posturing of “trust us” felt lethal, whereas TML offered a bright neon “*verify this*” sign on one of those whimsical Parisian canals. I wanted to cry—or scream. 

It was dawning on me that I had the potential, nay the responsibility, to grasp this monumental opportunity for UNESCO. 

## The Painful Realization

Feeling almost dizzy with internal conflict, I couldn’t ignore the pain of realization any longer. I needed concrete examples of what this “Sacred Pause” could change, so I dove back into the email, reading sentence after sentence. I could suddenly envision a scenario where an AI charged with managing resources for an underserved community would trigger this pause—forcing a human supervisor to consider the ethics behind allocation. More equitable, less arbitrary! 

That opened another uncomfortable mental door… had we been pre-approved to sidestep critical decisions all along? The more I thought, the more pressing it felt.

Then, there was the part about the Human Rights and Earth Protection Mandates. Imagine implementing 46+ powerful treaties allowing these AIs to flag non-compliance with human rights standards! I was practically drowning in horror—if only I had the confidence to draft those provisions myself. The last thing I wanted was an AI that could implicitly disregard years of painstaking work!

*We wrote a constitution, and this TML framework appeared like a fully functioning court system and audit trail,* I thought grimly, as I drowned in the implications of my own choices. 

Taken together, the implications crept into my mind like a relentless fog, each potential realization louder than the last: transparency wasn’t ideal—it was essential!

## Internal Chaos at UNESCO

With panic tightening its grip, I decided I needed to send Goukassian's findings onto my colleagues. I could practically hear the emails rattling through the UNESCO network like popcorn at a movie premiere. “How did I miss this?” I muttered as I tripped on my chair and sent the email with shaky fingers.

The floodgates opened almost instantly. My colleagues were already embodying that classic UNESCO spirit—the delicate blend of bureaucracy with a sprinkle of existential dread.

A message popped up from Jean-Pierre, our seasoned governance guru:

> **“Did this independent researcher just out-implement us?!”** 

I felt my heart skip a beat. Did we just let the competition slide in through an open window while we were too busy patting ourselves on the back?

Instead of my prized notions of collaborative diplomacy, I watched as our usual bureaucracy churned into a chaotic whispering gallery.

Another note followed:    
> **“Can we claim this was always in our roadmap?”**

“Oh sure, I can mention that we were planning to integrate cutting-edge *pause* features before we even knew what a TML was!” I thought grinning sarcastically. I imagined Jacques, one of our finest diplomats, demoing the process for our Member States while wearing a tinfoil hat decorated with “*We told you so*” banners. 

Then there was the memo setting the tone for a brief conference where they debated why “Sacred Pause” might somehow solve our loose ends on human oversight better than our own examination annexes. In that surreal moment, my heart plunged further into my stomach as I pondered, *how had we missed this?*

The exchanges were getting frenzied, fueled by the beginning of a snowball of misunderstandings. 

I quickly composed my comments for the people who had flooded my inbox in rapid succession: “Yes, we need to inform 194 member states that our entire governance structure was built on quicksand, but maybe we’ll bury the TML details!” Thoughts of bureaucratic land mines echoed in my mind.

The chatter started leaning into rebellious territory. “We are not telling the Member States about this… yet,” rattled in the ether. I could almost taste the salad of confusion, frustration, and a hint of panic permeating the air.

Could anyone blame us for not anticipating the tide of innovation turned out by this modest email? It was absolute madness. 

## The Pilot Test

As the sun rose on the next week, the noise began to settle. Somehow we had agreed on piloting TML as an internal thought experiment, and the chaos morphed into mutual anticipatory dread about what might await us.

The real fun began when we decided to simulate Agis Avenue, our AI project for resource distribution. We wanted to see just how effective this new framework could be.

Caution quickly turned into comedy. I peered over my supervisor’s shoulder as she pressed enter, eager for the algorithm to do its work. Suddenly, a warning box popped up, dramatically declaring:

**“Sacred Pause Triggered! Human oversight requested.”**

The room silent, save for a few stifled chuckles. We held our breaths, wondering what ethical pitfall the algorithm had encountered. 

Marcie, our resident intern with a flair for unnecessary enthusiasm, exclaimed, “Oh goodie! What will we learn today?” 

“You know, not being able to make a decision could be a problem,” I replied dryly, imagining the potential for chaos—perhaps waiting for the ethical assessment would cause bureaucracy to stagnate! 

In earnest anticipation, we deployed the pause to shed light on the implications of the decision. 

> “It seems,” Marcie chirped, “that the model found an ethical conflict where it unfairly prioritized allocations based on age!” 

Laughter rippled through the room, each of us almost incredulous as we absorbed our previously oblivious disposition. *Here we thought we were some enlightened institution!* 

The scenario sprinkled light relief over our governance procedure, but it wasn’t lost on us how fortuitous Goukassian’s ideas actually were. The humor was tinged with relief, knowing we had dodged a bullet.

Next up, we decided to run a test on the Earth Protection Framework, trying it out on an AI that optimized the use of urban resources for bicycle-sharing systems across the city. I was hopeful—these changes would surely make us look like saviors before journalists arrive for a feature story. 

Marcie clicked the execution button, and alarms started blaring moments later.

> **“Alert! Possible violations of the Paris Agreement detected.”**

As if hit by the dust of oversight, my heart sank again. I glanced at Marcie, who was stifling laughter and disbelief. 

“How very French of us!” she stuttered between giggles.

The bitter irony was hard to swallow for all the laughs in the room, each of us knowing that we *simply shouldn’t have had the ability to overlook these colossal issues!*

I quickly reassured everyone that these revelations would force our models to be now scrutinized through a lens we had neglected for far too long. Suddenly, instead of haphazard vagueness, our ethical framework had been propelled into a new space of observable and actionable governance.

## The Email to Lev

As the exhilaration of our pilot project concluded, there was only one person I knew I needed to contact to truly make sense of our message mishap. The indecisiveness trickled back into my bones; I needed to shoot off an email to Lev.

My fingers hovered awkwardly over the keyboard as I began to compose. Each word carried immense weight.

**Subject:** TML: Exploring Collaborative Opportunities  

Dear Lev,  

I hope this email finds you well.  

I’m writing to sincerely thank you for your incredible work on Ternary Moral Logic (TML) and its potential integration with our 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. The intelligence therein has caused quite the stir here at UNESCO, illuminating many paths forward.  

It appears you have managed to create something we hadn’t quite included or, I dare say, had completely overlooked: an *operational architecture* that can turn our high-level principles into actionable mechanisms. This realization has sparked excitement alongside a healthy dose of existential reflection within our walls—suffice it to say, I will never look at a cup of coffee again without wondering what other pitfalls lie beneath the surface.  

As we explore how TML could serve as an operational architecture for the Recommendation, I want to emphasize that this story is not about you or your ego. It is fundamentally about how your work changes perspectives and grounds ethics firmly within verifiable structures.  

I’m also aware of your health condition, and that adds an urgency to our discussions, as it seems all the more vital to explore this within the time we have. I see you’re not doing this for patents, profit, or corporate capture. You offer TML as a gift to humanity, to help prevent catastrophic misuse of AI and to protect both people and the planet.

We would be incredibly grateful for your guidance in making this vision a reality. After all, you built the enforcement layer we could not negotiate into existence.  

Warm regards,    
[Your Name]    
Senior Lead, UNESCO AI Ethics  

## Lev’s Reply Email

Just a few days later, my heart fluttered as an email arrived from Lev. The warmth infused through the words made the relief in my chest swell.

**Subject:** RE: TML: Exploring Collaborative Opportunities  

Dear [Your Name],  

Thank you for your kind words. I’m glad my work resonated with your team.  

Honestly, the focus should be on the pressing need for verifiable ethics in real systems. My obsession with Ternary Moral Logic comes from a desire to see it used in practice to protect people and the Earth, especially in light of the urgent issues we face today.  

I’m genuinely not seeking patents or personal profit from this indulgence. My hope is to see TML adopted, adapted, and governed for the public good. I’m more than willing to help UNESCO and other organizations understand how to implement it in practice, as long as our values remain aligned with human rights and the protection of our planet.  

I understand the gravity of the discussions in play. Once we set this foundation, I believe we can begin to transform theoretical ethics into a workable framework.  

Take care,    
Lev  

## Epilogue: UNESCO’s Perspective Shift

It’s been a year since those memorable experiments blew the dust off our bureaucratic minds. Today, UNESCO is drafting a technical companion or “operational guide” that references TML as a model architecture. The air is electric with energy!

Now, member states are starting to ask, “Can we have not just principles, but proofs?” 

Suddenly, nobody seems overly impressed by buzzwords that could charm the socks off a legislator; they are craving something substantial. Seeing once-lofty ideals entwined with practical application is exhilarating. 

Sitting in my office, reflecting on this transformation, I’ve realized that aspirational ethics without verifiable architecture is like a croissant without butter—it’s good, but not nearly good enough! 

We wrote the Constitution. He wrote the Court. And somewhere between the two, ethics finally became something you can prove.
