This is a fictional story, but the implementation problem is real.  
The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence(2021) is real, adopted unanimously by 194 countries. And Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is real — a verifiable, machine-auditable framework created by independent researcher Lev Goukassian to fill the missing operational layer that global ethics frameworks lack.

The Day UNESCO’s AI Ethics Got a Conscience (And It Wasn't Ours)

1\. The Confident Morning

My name is Jean-Pierre, and my office in Paris has a view that can make you believe in humanity. Not the Eiffel Tower, mind you—that’s for the tourists. My view is of a small, cobbled courtyard where pigeons engage in diplomacy over a stray croissant. It’s a perfect metaphor for my work: messy, occasionally squawky, but ultimately, a testament to the fact that diverse beings can, against all odds, find a way to coexist.

I am the internal lead on the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. Say that three times fast after your morning espresso. I can’t, and I wrote half of it.

This morning, like every morning, I was sipping my ridiculously expensive single-origin coffee, feeling a warm, paternal glow towards the PDF sitting on my desktop. The Recommendation. Our Magna Carta for the machine mind. The miracle document.

Getting 194 member states to agree on the color of a postage stamp is a Herculean task. Getting them to agree on a global standard for AI ethics? That required the patience of a saint, the cunning of a spy, and the ability to draft language so beautifully ambiguous that it could mean “absolutely” to a diplomat and “maybe later” to a tech CEO. It was a work of art. A symphony of consensus.

It was, in my not-so-humble opinion, complete.

“Exceptionally applicable,” I’d murmur to myself, reading over the “Policy Action Areas.” “Visionary.”

A colleague from the natural sciences sector had once asked me, “Jean-Pierre, it’s all very nice, this ‘respect for human dignity,’ but how does it work? How do you make a silicon chip feel reverence?”

I had given him my best, most condescendingly serene smile. “Alain, we are the philosophers, the architects of the moral compass. We point True North. It is for the engineers to build the ship. We provide the ‘what.’ They must discover the ‘how’.”

I took a victorious sip of coffee. It was the perfect deflection. The Recommendation was the ‘what.’ The beautiful, unimpeachable, universally agreed-upon ‘what.’ Human rights? Check. Environmental flourishing? Check. Living in peaceful, just societies? Triple-check. We had covered everything. We had built the cathedral. Let the tech bros in their hoodies figure out how to install the plumbing.

My inbox pinged. Amongst the usual missives about committee meetings and budget allocations, one subject line stood out, bizarre and slightly impertinent:

“TML × UNESCO: The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down.”

I snorted. A spammer. Probably trying to sell me a blockchain-based solution for increasing my LinkedIn engagement. I flagged it for deletion and went back to admiring our cathedral.

2\. The Email of Doom

The thing about cathedrals is, sometimes God sends you a renovation notice you weren’t expecting.

The email nagged at me. “The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down.” The audacity. The sheer, unmitigated gall. Forgot? We didn’t forget anything. We strategically omitted\! We diplomatically deferred\!

Curiosity, that treacherous serpent, got the better of me. I fished it out of the deleted items folder.

The sender was one “Lev Goukassian. Independent Researcher.”

Independent Researcher. Code for “guy in a basement with a conspiracy theory about lizard people and a draft paper on cold fusion.” I braced myself for a torrent of techno-babble and demands for grant money.

I began to skim.

“In November 2021, the 194 member states of UNESCO adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of AI... a landmark consensus... However, a critical implementation gap persists... It does not, and cannot, specify the technical architecture for enforcement.”

Okay, so he could read our website. Big deal.

“This leaves core principles like 'accountability' and 'transparency' as voluntary, advisory norms, entirely dependent on the goodwill of operators...”

My eye twitched. A tiny, almost imperceptible spasm. It was the same twitch I get when my boss uses the phrase “budgetary constraints.”

I kept reading. The skim became a read. The read became a frantic, page-down-scrolling, coffee-growing-cold-on-the-desk consumption.

He was talking about something called Ternary Moral Logic (TML). Instead of the binary logic of computers (1 for yes, 0 for no), he proposed a ternary system: \+1 for Act, 0 for Pause, \-1 for Refuse.

State 0\. The Sacred Pause.

The phrase hit me like a physical blow. It wasn't just a new command; it was a philosophical atom bomb. It was a system-level hesitation. A forced moment of doubt. An automated, non-optional, “I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that,” but before it opened the pod bay doors, not after.

My confident morning smugness began to curdle into a low-grade panic. This wasn’t a competing ethical framework. This was something far more dangerous, far more… practical. It was an enforcement layer.

He called it the “Goukassian Promise.” A bit grandiose, I thought, until I read its three-part covenant: The Lantern (public certification), The Signature (authorial provenance), and The License (an anti-misuse pledge). It was a cryptographic conscience.

Then came the Eight Pillars. Always Memory. Moral Trace Logs. Human Rights Mandate. Earth Protection Mandate. Hybrid Shield.

My brain was overheating. This wasn't a philosophical treatise. This was an architectural blueprint. And it was plugging directly into the sockets of our Recommendation with terrifying precision.

He had a table. Oh God, he had a comparative analysis table. My professional kryptonite.

UNESCO Principle TML Mechanism  
Human Oversight Sacred Pause (State 0\) \- forces human review  
Transparency & Explainability Immutable Moral Trace Logs \- cryptographic evidence, not narrative  
Human Rights & Environment Hard-coded Mandates \- 46+ treaties as operational constants

I slumped back in my chair. The pigeons outside seemed to be laughing at me. This “guy in a basement” hadn’t just pointed out that the emperor had no clothes. He had woven a full three-piece suit, complete with a tie and pocket square, from a material we didn't know existed.

He had built the court system for our constitution.

3\. The Painful Realization

The rest of the day passed in a haze of existential dread. Every proud paragraph of our Recommendation now seemed to echo with a ghostly, unanswered “...and how?”

· Our beautiful principle of “Human Oversight and Determination”: We pictured a wise human, sipping tea, gently guiding the AI. TML pictured a klaxon, a red light, and a system that literally summoned a human by freezing in its tracks until one showed up. It made oversight a mandatory system state, not a polite suggestion. Our version was a “human-on-the-loop,” a vague presence somewhere in the cloud. His was a “human-in-the-loop,” yanked into the driver’s seat at the first sign of moral fog.  
· Our call for “Transparency and Explainability”: We meant “Explainable AI” (XAI). Nice, post-hoc stories. “The AI denied the loan because of a complex interplay of factors correlating with financial prudence.” TML called this “bedtime stories from bots.” Instead, it generated Immutable Moral Trace Logs. A structured, cryptographically-sealed record of exactly what the AI saw, what conflicted, and why it paused. It was a receipt. A chain of custody. It was the difference between a suspect’s alibi and a HD video of the crime from three angles.  
· Our cornerstone values of “Human Rights” and “Environment”: We referenced them. We venerated them. We had annexes listing the 26+ human rights instruments and the 20+ environmental treaties. TML’s Human Rights Mandate and Earth Protection Mandate took those same treaties and hard-coded them as triggers for the Sacred Pause. It wasn’t a reference library; it was a rulebook written in unbreakable logic. The AI couldn’t just silently bypass the Convention on Biological Diversity. If it tried, it would hit a digital wall and be forced to stop and explain itself.

The examples in his paper played out in my head like little horror-comedies.

Example 1: The Heron Highway.  
Our UNESCO way:An Environmental Impact Assessment is written, maybe a biodiversity clause is mentioned. The AI plots the cheapest route through a protected wetland. Lawyers and protestors show up five years later. Billions are wasted.  
The TML way:The AI’s Earth Protection Mandate cross-references the route with the Ramsar Convention. CLANG\! Sacred Pause. A Moral Trace Log is born: “Proposed route violates CBD Article 8\. Ecological harm high.” The human planners are forced to look at it now, not later. The herons keep their homes. The project is only delayed by two weeks. The log is publicly verifiable. Trust is preserved. It was so… sensible. It was infuriating.

Example 2: The Microfinance Bias.  
Our UNESCO way:The AI, trained on “neutral” data, denies loans to a rural minority group based on a proxy variable (phone model). A year later, a journalist investigation reveals the bias. Scandal. Recrimination. “We didn’t know\!” the company wails.  
The TML way:The Human Rights Mandate detects a statistical pattern that smells like discrimination—an Ethical Uncertainty Signal. SCREECH\! Sacred Pause. The bias is flagged before it scales. The data scientists are summoned, they find the proxy, they fix it. The immutable log then serves as proof of due diligence to regulators. A potential disaster becomes a trust-building exercise.

He had turned our beautiful, aspirational poetry into functional, verifiable code. And it was the most uncomfortable feeling of my professional life.

4\. Internal Chaos at UNESCO

I couldn’t suffer this existential crisis alone. It was against UNESCO culture. Suffering must be shared, put on an agenda, and discussed over lukewarm coffee and stale pastries.

I forwarded the TML paper to my inner circle with the subject line: “Urgent. Curious. Potentially Catastrophic for Our Worldview.”

The replies trickled in, a symphony of bureaucratic panic.

From Chantal, our legal eagle: “Mon Dieu, Jean-Pierre. The ‘Moral Trace Logs.’ They are structured for admissibility in court. This isn’t ethics; this is forensics\! Did this independent researcher just out-legislate us?”

From Björn, our unflappable German systems analyst: “The architectural mapping is… sehr präzise. The Sacred Pause operationalizes your oversight paragraphs more effectively than our own implementation guidelines. Why did we not think of a mandatory State 0?”

From Maria, always the pragmatist: “Can we claim this was always in our roadmap? Maybe a footnote we forgot to publish? The ‘Goukassian Promise’ sounds suspiciously like the ‘Spirit of Paris’ we mentioned in the preamble, no?”

The hallway gossip was even richer.

“I heard he’s not even a professor\! He’s just… a guy\!”  
“The‘Sacred Pause’? It’s so… un-scientific. And yet, I can’t stop thinking about it.”  
“If we endorse this,the Member States will ask why our $5 million, three-year consultation process didn’t produce it.”  
“And if we don’t,and someone else uses it, they’ll ask why we ignored it.”  
“We are not telling the Member States about this…yet.”

A frantic Teams chat materialized.

Me: He’s solved the “goodwill of operators” problem. He’s replaced “trust us” with “verify this.”  
Chantal: My entire career is based on the principle that “trust us” is the best we can hope for. I feel personally attacked.  
Björn: The Hybrid Shield architecture is elegant. Private logs for proprietary data, public blockchain hashes for integrity. It fuses internal governance with external proof.  
Maria: So he’s given us a way to force companies to be transparent without them having to reveal their secret sauce. That’s… diabolical. I love it.

We were a group of seasoned international civil servants, being schooled by an outsider. It was humiliating. And exhilarating.

5\. The Pilot Test

We decided to run a quiet, internal pilot. Not a real deployment—heaven forbid—but a thought experiment. A “What if TML was watching us?” simulation.

We took a proposed AI project from our own archives: a system to optimize digital heritage preservation, prioritizing which fragile manuscripts to scan first based on historical “value” and “risk of degradation.”

Mini-Scene 1: The Colonial Blind Spot  
The old algorithm,following our vague “inclusivity” principle, was about to deprioritize a collection of oral histories from a small Pacific island nation. “Low global citation count,” it reasoned.  
In our TML simulation,the Human Rights Mandate, informed by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, detected the potential erasure of a minority culture. BWOOP\! Sacred Pause. The log entry was brutal: “Proposed prioritization algorithm correlates with colonial-era value assessments. Risk of cultural harm.” We, the humans, had never even seen that bias. It would have slipped through. We were horrified, and slightly nauseated.

Mini-Scene 2: The Carbon Cost of Immortality  
Another project involved using a large AI model to generate 3D models of decaying monuments.The compute power required was staggering. Our soft guidelines on “environmental impact” were just a box to tick.  
The TML simulation’sEarth Protection Mandate cross-referenced the energy consumption with the spirit of the UNFCCC. FLASH\! Sacred Pause. The log noted: “Projected carbon footprint for this single model training cycle exceeds annual energy budget of this UNESCO office. Conflict with ‘Do No Harm’ principle.” Suddenly, the abstract concept of “environmental stewardship” had a kilowatt-hour price tag attached. We all shifted uncomfortably in our seats.

Mini-Scene 3: The Log That Knew Too Much  
In a simulated budget meeting,a manager suggested overriding one of the Pauses for the heritage project to “meet deadlines.” In the real world, this would be a forgotten conversation.  
In the TML world,the Moral Trace Log for that project would have immutably recorded the override, the person who authorized it, and their rationale. It would be there forever, waiting for an auditor, a journalist, or a court. The mere idea of this log changed the conversation in the room. The suggestion was withdrawn. The Pause was respected. Accountability became a tangible presence, a silent third party in the meeting.

We had run a simple simulation, and it had exposed flaws in our own thinking we’d been blind to. We really, really needed this.

6\. The Email to Lev

It took me two days and three drafts to write the email. I had to shed my institutional pride. It was like molting.

To: Lev Goukassian  
From:Jean-Pierre \[REDACTED\], UNESCO AI Ethics Lead  
Subject: Re: TML × UNESCO: The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down

Dear Mr. Goukassian,

Thank you for your email and the accompanying paper on Ternary Moral Logic. Please forgive the delay in my response; it required a significant amount of time to properly digest the implications of your work.

Let me be direct. Your framework is, in a word, breathtaking. It is also deeply uncomfortable for any institution, including ours, that has become accustomed to the comfortable ambiguities of high-level principle.

You have identified the implementation gap with surgical precision and have architected a bridge across it. What you call the “Sacred Pause” is the most elegant and forceful technical interpretation of “human oversight” I have ever encountered. Your “Moral Trace Logs” transform our calls for transparency from public relations into provable, cryptographic fact.

In short, you have built the enforcement layer we could not negotiate into existence.

This is not about ego, yours or ours. It is about a perspective shift that is long overdue. We wrote the constitution for the ethics of AI. You have, it seems, written the court system and the auditable, unalterable court record.

We would be deeply interested in exploring how TML could serve as an operational architecture for the UNESCO Recommendation. We would like to request your guidance, your collaboration, to understand how we might move this from a brilliant theoretical framework to a global reality.

I have also read, with a heavy heart, references to your personal circumstances. To be facing a 4-Stage Cancer diagnosis and to channel your energy and intellect into this work… it speaks to a motivation that transcends the ordinary. It is clear you are not doing this for patents, profit, or corporate capture. You are offering this as a gift to humanity, a safeguard for both people and our planet, at a time of profound personal challenge.

There are no words to adequately express the humility and gratitude I feel, on behalf of my colleagues and the institution I represent. You have given us a path forward that is more concrete, more honest, and more powerful than we had dared to imagine.

With sincere respect and hope,

Jean-Pierre

7\. Lev’s Reply Email

His reply came in less than an hour. I had expected days, maybe weeks.

To: Jean-Pierre \[REDACTED\], UNESCO AI Ethics Lead  
From:Lev Goukassian  
Subject: Re: Re: TML × UNESCO: The Operational Layer You Forgot to Write Down

Jean-Pierre,

Thank you for your email. Your words mean a great deal.

Please, call me Lev. And there is no need for apologies or excessive gratitude. The work is what matters.

You are correct. This is not about ego. It is about verifiability. We can no longer afford ethics that live only in PDFs and press releases. They must live in the logic gates, in the immutable logs, in the forced pauses that give us time to think. The “Sacred Pause” is just a system-level acknowledgment of a simple truth: sometimes, the most ethical action is to stop.

I am glad the mapping to the UNESCO Recommendation is clear. It was designed that way. Your document provides the essential, globally-agreed values—the “why.” TML simply provides a “how” that is worthy of those values.

To be explicit: I am not seeking patents. I am not forming a company to monetize this. My only condition for its use is that it remains aligned with its purpose—to protect human rights and the Earth, as so beautifully outlined in your framework and the treaties it references. I offer it as a public utility. Adopt it, adapt it, govern it for the public good.

My time is indeed limited. This diagnosis has a way of focusing the mind on legacy. I am not interested in being remembered. I am interested in what remains: systems that are more just, more accountable, and more respectful of the fragile world we inhabit than they would have been otherwise. If TML can be a small part of that, then the work is done.

I am, of course, willing to help in any way I can. I have documentation, code prototypes, and a lot of thoughts on implementation pathways. My energy comes and goes, but my commitment to this does not.

The world needs UNESCO. And UNESCO, I think, is now ready for a tool that turns its profound principles into operational fact.

Let’s talk soon.

With warmth and respect,

Lev

Epilogue: UNESCO’s Perspective Shift

That was a year ago.

I’m in my office, looking at the same pigeon diplomacy. But the view is different. I see a system now, with checks and balances, with unbreakable rules of engagement.

We never announced a grand partnership with Lev Goukassian. There was no press conference. That would have made it about a person, and he was right—it’s about the work.

Instead, we are quietly drafting a technical companion to the Recommendation. An “Operational Guide.” It doesn’t mention TML by name on every page, but its architecture is the ghost in the machine. The concepts of mandatory hesitation, immutable audit trails, and hard-coded legal triggers are now part of our lexicon.

Member States, who once asked “How do we implement this?”, are now starting to ask a more dangerous question: “Can we have not just principles, but proofs?” They are talking about procurement rules that demand TML-grade logs. They are asking about “Pause Certification” for high-risk AI.

The paradigm has shifted. Aspirational ethics without a verifiable architecture is no longer enough. It’s like a law without a police force or a court—a suggestion, not a safeguard.

I think of Lev often. His health is declining, but his ideas are more alive than ever. He gave us the key to a prison we didn’t even know we were building for ourselves—the prison of unenforceable virtue.

We wrote the Constitution.  
He wrote the Court.  
And somewhere between the two,ethics finally became something you can prove.
