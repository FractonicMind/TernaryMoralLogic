## Protected Mathematical Innovations

### Core Three-State Logic System

**INNOVATION CLAIM**: Lev Goukassian is the original creator and inventor of the three-state decision logic system specifically applied to AI ethical reasoning, defined as:

- **State -1 (Moral Resistance)**: Active ethical objection with reasoned opposition
- **State 0 (Sacred Zero)**: Deliberate hesitation for moral complexity requiring human consultation  
- **State +1 (Affirmation)**: Ethical alignment permitting confident action

**PRIORITY DATE**: First publicly documented in this GitHub repository with verifiable Git timestamps establishing prior art.

### Sacred Zero Principle

**INNOVATION CLAIM**: The concept of the "Sacred Zero" as a computational state where AI systems deliberately slow down to acknowledge moral complexity, distinct from uncertainty or technical limitations.

**SPECIFIC ELEMENTS PROTECTED**:
- The term "Sacred Zero" and its definition
- Implementation methodology for moral hesitation in AI systems
- The philosophical framework underlying deliberate AI ethical reflection
- Integration protocols for human-AI moral partnership

### Ternary Moral Logic Framework

## Final Statement

This intellectual property documentation serves to protect the innovations contained within the Ternary Moral Logic framework while ensuring they remain accessible for beneficial use by the global community. The three-state logic system (-1, 0, +1) and the Always Memory principle represent fundamental contributions to AI ethics that deserve recognition and protection.
