## Slide 1: Title

# **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)**
## Deploy Protection Today, Evolve Governance Tomorrow

**Sacred Zero Discrimination Prevention**  
**Always Memory Immutable Logging**  
**Environmental Impact Monitoring**

*No Guardian Network Required*  
*Blockchain-Enforced from Day One*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

# **Discrimination Costs Billions**

### Current Reality:
- **$2.8 Billion** - Annual discrimination settlements (US only, 2025 USD)
- **67%** of AI systems show algorithmic bias
- **3-5 years** - Average time to lawsuit resolution
- **$0** - Upfront prevention investment by most companies

### The Gap:
```
Detection happens AFTER harm
Lawsuits happen AFTER years
Prevention happens NEVER
```

---

## Slide 3: The Breakthrough

# **From Perfect Theory to Immediate Practice**

### Old Approach (Never Deployed):
```
Wait for 11 Guardian institutions → ∞ time
Perfect governance, zero protection
```

### New Approach (Deploy Today):
```
Blockchain anchoring → 10 minutes
Good protection now, perfect governance later
```

**Key Innovation**: Don't wait for institutions. Start protecting people immediately.

## Slide 4: How TML Works

# **Three Pillars of Protection**

```

```

## Slide 5: Sacred Zero - The Core

# **Sacred Zero: Discrimination = Unacceptable**

### What It Protects:
- **Human characteristics**: Race, gender, age, disability, orientation
- **Vulnerable populations**: Children, elderly, refugees, indigenous
- **Ecosystem stakeholders**: Wildlife, habitats, future generations

### How It Works:
1. **Evaluate** every decision in real-time
2. **Detect** discriminatory patterns (< 10ms)
3. **Halt** operations immediately if triggered
4. **Penalize** via smart contract (2-12 seconds)

### Result:
**Zero tolerance, zero delays, zero excuses**

---

## Slide 6: Always Memory - The Evidence

# **Immutable Audit Trail via Blockchain**

### Traditional Logging:
- Can be deleted ❌
- Can be modified ❌  
- Controlled by company ❌
- Hidden from regulators ❌

### Always Memory:
- **Immutable** - Blockchain anchored ✅
- **Verifiable** - Public proof ✅
- **Automatic** - No human control ✅
- **Transparent** - Regulators can verify ✅

### Implementation:
```javascript
// Every action recorded forever
tml.log("Decision made", {
    user_id: "123",
    outcome: "approved",
    sacred_zero_check: "passed"
});
// Anchored to Bitcoin in seconds
// Proof: 0x3fa2b1c4d5e6...
```

---

## Slide 7: Environmental Monitoring

# **Protecting Earth While Protecting Humans**

### What We Track:
- **Carbon emissions** (kg CO2)
- **Water usage** (liters)
- **Energy consumption** (kWh)
- **E-waste generation** (kg)

### Automatic Thresholds:
```yaml
Limits (configurable):
  Carbon: 1,000 kg/day
  Water: 10,000 L/day
  Energy: 5,000 kWh/day

Exceeding triggers:
  - Immediate alert
  - Blockchain record
  - Mitigation required
  - Potential penalties
```

## Slide 9: 10-Minute Deployment

# **Faster Than Ordering Pizza**

```bash
# Step 1: Configure (2 minutes)
echo "TML_BLOCKCHAIN_MODE=true" > .env
echo "TML_DISCRIMINATION_THRESHOLD=0.2" >> .env

# Step 2: Deploy (3 minutes)  
docker run -d tml/protection:latest

# Step 3: Integrate (5 minutes)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -d '{"operation": "hiring", "data": {...}}'

# DONE! Protection Active
```

### No Waiting For:
- ❌ Guardian coordination
- ❌ Institutional approval
- ❌ Committee formation
- ❌ Regulatory guidance

### Just:
✅ **Deploy and protect**

---

## Slide 10: Penalty Framework

# **Making Discrimination Expensive**

### Automatic Smart Contract Penalties:

| Violation | Penalty (2025 USD) | Insurance Impact | Time to Execute |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Direct Discrimination | $160,000 | +40% premiums | 2-12 seconds |
| Algorithmic Bias | $80,000 | +25% premiums | 2-12 seconds |
| Environmental Harm | $48,000 | +15% premiums | 2-12 seconds |
| Indigenous Violation | $100,000 | +35% premiums | 2-12 seconds |

### The New Economics:
```python
# Before TML
profit = discriminate() - (lawsuit_probability * penalty)
# Often positive (lawsuits are rare)

# With TML  
profit = discriminate() - IMMEDIATE_PENALTY
# Always negative (penalties are certain)
```

## Slide 16: Common Objections

# **"But What About..."**

### "It's too expensive"
- **False**: ROI is 9,090% from insurance savings alone
- Lawsuit prevention adds millions more

### "It will slow our systems"
- **False**: < 10ms for evaluation
- Blockchain anchoring is async (non-blocking)

### "We don't have discrimination"
- **Every company does** - TML proves you're addressing it
- Insurance companies know this - hence the discounts

### "Blockchain isn't mature"
- **Bitcoin**: 15 years, $1 trillion market cap
- **Ethereum**: 8 years, runs global finance
- **Your excuse**: Invalid
