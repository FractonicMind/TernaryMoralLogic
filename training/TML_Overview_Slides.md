## Slide 1: Title

# **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)**
## Blockchain-Based Ethical AI Framework
### Enhanced by Six-Member Stewardship Council

**Sacred Zero Discrimination Prevention**  
**Always Memory Immutable Logging**  
**Environmental Impact Monitoring**  
**Institutional Oversight & Validation**

*Blockchain-Enforced Protection*  
*Recommended Stewardship Council Enhancement*

---

## Slide 2: The Technical Challenge

# **Discrimination in Algorithmic Systems**

### Current State:
- **$2.8 Billion** - Annual discrimination settlements (US only, 2025 USD)
- **67%** of AI systems show measurable algorithmic bias
- **3-5 years** - Average time to lawsuit resolution
- **Minimal** - Upfront prevention investment by most organizations

### The Technical Gap:
```
Detection occurs post-harm
Legal resolution takes years
Prevention remains minimal
Institutional oversight absent
```

---

## Slide 3: The Technical Approach

# **From Theory to Implementation**

### Previous Limitations:
```
Coordination requirements → Deployment delay
Perfect governance, limited protection
No institutional validation
```

### Current Architecture:
```
Blockchain anchoring → Immediate deployment
Stewardship Council → Recommended institutional oversight
Operational protection with expert validation
```

**Technical Innovation**: Blockchain-based protection enables immediate deployment. Recommended six-member Stewardship Council provides institutional validation, victim support, and democratic accountability.

## Slide 5: Sacred Zero Implementation

# **Sacred Zero: Technical Foundation with Council Oversight**

### Protected Categories:
- **Human characteristics**: Race, gender, age, disability, orientation
- **Vulnerable populations**: Children, elderly, refugees, indigenous
- **Ecosystem stakeholders**: Wildlife, habitats, future generations

### Operational Process:
1. **Evaluate** every decision in real-time
2. **Detect** discriminatory patterns (< 10ms)
3. **Halt** operations immediately if triggered
