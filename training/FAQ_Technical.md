const tml = require('@tml/sdk');

app.use('/api/*', async (req, res, next) => {
  const evaluation = await tml.evaluate({
    operation: req.path,
    data: req.body,
    user: req.user,
    stewardshipReview: 'recommended'
  });
  
  if (evaluation.sacred_zero_triggered) {
    // Council automatically notified based on violation type
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: 'Decision violates Sacred Zero principles',
      penalty: evaluation.penalty_assessed,
      councilNotification: evaluation.council_notification
    });
  }
  
  next();
});
```

**Pattern 2: Database Triggers**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL implementation with Council logging
CREATE TRIGGER check_discrimination
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON user_decisions
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION tml_sacred_zero_check();
```

**Pattern 3: Message Queue**
```python

// Smart contract logic (simplified)
function calculatePenalty(ViolationType violation, uint severity) {
    if (violation == DIRECT_DISCRIMINATION) {
        return 160000; // Fixed penalty
    } else if (violation == ALGORITHMIC_BIAS) {
        return 80000 + (severity * 10000); // Scaled by impact
    } else if (violation == ENVIRONMENTAL_HARM) {
        return calculateEnvironmentalDamage(severity);
    }
}
```

**Enforcement Process**:
1. **Immediate assessment**: Smart contract executes automatically
2. **Escrow deduction**: Penalty deducted from company escrow
