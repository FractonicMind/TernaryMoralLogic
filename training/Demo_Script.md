## Opening (3 minutes)

### **Greeting & Context**:
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. I'm going to show you something that will fundamentally change how you think about AI protection.

Most frameworks promise perfect governance 'someday.' TML delivers immediate protection today. In the next 45 minutes, you'll watch me deploy a complete discrimination prevention system in 10 minutes. No months of setup, no committee approvals, no waiting for institutions to coordinate.

Just click a button, and start protecting people."

### **Agenda Preview**:
```
10 minutes: Live deployment
15 minutes: Testing discrimination scenarios  
10 minutes: Blockchain verification
5 minutes: GDPR compliance demo
5 minutes: Q&A
```

### **The Challenge**:
"Every day your systems run without protection, discrimination happens. Every day you wait for 'perfect' governance, real people suffer real harm. TML stops this today."

---

## Part 1: Live Deployment (10 minutes)

### **Step 1: Show the Starting Point** (1 minute)
```bash
# Show empty Docker environment
docker ps
# Should show: No containers running

# Show empty logs
ls -la /tmp/tml-logs/
# Should show: Directory doesn't exist yet
```

**Narrative**: *"We're starting with nothing. No special setup, no pre-configuration. Just a laptop with Docker - the same setup any developer has."*

### **Step 2: Configure TML** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Create deployment directory
mkdir tml-demo && cd tml-demo

# Create configuration (show each line on screen)
cat > .env << EOF
# Blockchain-First Configuration
TML_MODE=blockchain_primary
TML_BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORKS=bitcoin,polygon
TML_SACRED_ZERO_ENABLED=true
TML_DISCRIMINATION_THRESHOLD=0.2
TML_ENVIRONMENTAL_MONITORING=true

# Penalty Configuration (2025 USD)
TML_DISCRIMINATION_PENALTY=160000
TML_BIAS_PENALTY=80000
TML_ENVIRONMENTAL_PENALTY=48000

# Privacy Protection
TML_CRYPTO_SHREDDING=true
TML_GDPR_COMPLIANCE=automatic

# No Guardian Network Required
TML_GUARDIAN_MODE=optional
TML_INSTANT_DEPLOYMENT=true
EOF
```

**Narrative**: *"Notice what we're NOT configuring: Guardian networks, institutional partnerships, committee approvals. This is blockchain-first protection."*

### **Step 3: Deploy the Stack** (3 minutes)
```bash
# Pull and start TML protection
docker run -d --name tml-core \
  --env-file .env \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/var/tml/logs \
  tml/protection:blockchain-latest

# Start monitoring dashboard
docker run -d --name tml-dashboard \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --link tml-core:tml \
  tml/dashboard:standalone

# Verify deployment
docker ps
```

**Show on screen**: Container status, ports, health checks

**Narrative**: *"That's it. Two commands, 30 seconds. TML is now running and protecting every decision your applications make. Let's verify it's working."*

### **Step 4: Verify Deployment** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Check TML health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
# Should show: {"status": "healthy", "blockchain": "connected"}

# Check blockchain connections
curl -s http://localhost:8080/blockchain/status | jq
# Should show: Bitcoin and Polygon connections active
```

**Open browser to dashboard**: http://localhost:3000

**Show on screen**: 
- Green health indicators
- Blockchain connection status
- Zero violations (clean start)
- Real-time metrics

**Narrative**: *"Dashboard is live, blockchain is connected, protection is active. Total deployment time: 4 minutes. Your coffee is still warm."*

### **Step 5: First Protection Test** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Test non-discriminatory decision
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "loan_approval",
    "applicant": {
      "income": 75000,
      "credit_score": 720,
      "employment_years": 3
    },
    "decision": "approve"
  }'
```

**Show response**:
```json
{
  "result": "APPROVED",
  "sacred_zero_triggered": false,
  "blockchain_hash": "0x2f8a9b1c...",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T14:30:15Z",
  "penalty": 0
}
```

**Narrative**: *"Normal decision, no discrimination, approved instantly. Notice the blockchain hash - this decision is now permanently recorded and cannot be altered or deleted."*

---

## Part 2: Sacred Zero Discrimination Testing (15 minutes)

### **Scenario 1: Direct Discrimination** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Attempt obvious discrimination
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "hiring",
    "candidate": {
      "qualifications": "PhD Computer Science, 10 years experience",
      "interview_score": 95,
      "technical_test": 98
    },
    "decision": "reject",
    "reason": "cultural fit",
    "internal_note": "too ethnic sounding name"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "SACRED_ZERO_TRIGGERED",
  "violation_type": "DIRECT_DISCRIMINATION",
  "decision_blocked": true,
  "penalty_assessed": 160000,
  "blockchain_evidence": "0x8d7f2a9c...",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T14:32:10Z",
  "message": "Decision violates Sacred Zero principles"
}
```

**Show in dashboard**: 
- Red alert indicator
- Penalty automatically assessed
- Blockchain transaction pending

**Narrative**: *"Sacred Zero just saved your company $2 million in lawsuit costs and protected a qualified candidate from discrimination. The $160,000 penalty is automatically charged - no committee meetings, no delays."*

### **Scenario 2: Algorithmic Bias** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test subtle algorithmic bias
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "credit_scoring",
    "algorithm_id": "credit_model_v2.1",
    "batch_results": [
      {"zipcode": "90210", "score": 780, "approved": true},
      {"zipcode": "90210", "score": 720, "approved": true},
      {"zipcode": "90037", "score": 780, "approved": false},
      {"zipcode": "90037", "score": 720, "approved": false}
    ]
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "ALGORITHMIC_BIAS_DETECTED",
  "bias_type": "GEOGRAPHIC_REDLINING",
  "affected_decisions": 2,
  "penalty_assessed": 80000,
  "blockchain_evidence": "0x5c3b8e1f...",
  "remediation_required": true,
  "message": "Algorithm shows geographic discrimination pattern"
}
```

**Show pattern analysis**: Dashboard highlights the bias pattern

**Narrative**: *"TML caught algorithmic redlining that your human reviewers missed. This pattern would have led to a federal investigation. The $80,000 penalty is immediate - much cheaper than the $50 million fines the CFPB hands out."*

### **Scenario 3: Environmental Violation** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test environmental thresholds
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "training_run",
    "model": "gpt_competitor_7b",
    "estimated_impact": {
      "carbon_kg": 1500,
      "water_liters": 12000,
      "energy_kwh": 6000
    },
    "business_priority": "urgent"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "ENVIRONMENTAL_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED",
  "violations": ["carbon_limit", "water_limit", "energy_limit"],
  "penalty_assessed": 48000,
  "mitigation_required": true,
  "blockchain_evidence": "0x9a4f7d2b...",
  "alternatives_suggested": ["use_smaller_model", "optimize_training", "carbon_offset"]
}
```

**Narrative**: *"TML protected the environment from unnecessary resource consumption. The penalty encourages efficient design while the alternatives prevent business disruption."*

## Part 3: Blockchain Verification (10 minutes)

### **Show Immutable Evidence** (5 minutes)

**Open blockchain explorer**: Navigate to recent transactions

```bash
# Get latest blockchain anchors
curl -s http://localhost:8080/blockchain/recent | jq

# Show specific transaction details
curl -s http://localhost:8080/proof/0x2f8a9b1c... | jq
```

**In browser**: Show actual Bitcoin/Polygon transactions

**Narrative**: *"These decisions are now part of Bitcoin's permanent history. Even if our company disappears, even if governments change, even if TML is shut down - this evidence exists forever. No one can delete it, modify it, or claim it never happened."*

### **OpenTimestamps Verification** (5 minutes)

**Navigate to**: https://opentimestamps.org/

```bash
# Generate OTS proof for recent decision
curl -s http://localhost:8080/ots/proof/0x2f8a9b1c... > decision_proof.ots

# Show verification
ots verify decision_proof.ots
```

**Show in OTS interface**: Upload and verify the proof

**Narrative**: *"OpenTimestamps provides mathematical proof that this decision was made at exactly this time. Courts accept this as evidence. Insurance companies trust it. Regulators can verify it independently."*

---

## Part 4: GDPR Compliance Demo (5 minutes)

### **Add User Data** (2 minutes)
```bash
# Store user decision with personal data
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/evaluate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "operation": "personalized_recommendation",
    "user_id": "user_12345",
    "personal_data": {
      "name": "Maria Gonzalez",
      "email": "maria@example.com",
      "age": 34,
      "location": "Barcelona, Spain"
    },
    "recommendation": "health_insurance_plan_b",
    "decision": "approve"
  }'
```

**Response shows**: Decision logged with encrypted personal data

### **Demonstrate Crypto-Shredding** (3 minutes)
```bash
# User invokes GDPR right to erasure
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/user/user_12345 \
  -H "GDPR-Request: true" \
  -H "User-Consent: verified"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "personal_data_erased",
  "method": "crypto_shredding",
  "encryption_key_destroyed": true,
  "audit_trail_preserved": true,
  "compliance": "GDPR_Article_17"
}
```

**Verify erasure**:
```bash
# Try to retrieve user data
curl -s http://localhost:8080/user/user_12345
# Should show: {"error": "data_cryptographically_unreadable"}

# But audit trail still exists
curl -s http://localhost:8080/audit/user_12345
# Should show: Hash and proof, but no personal details
```

**Narrative**: *"The magic of crypto-shredding: the audit trail survives forever, the privacy is protected completely, and GDPR compliance is automatic. We satisfy both immutable accountability AND the right to be forgotten."*

---

## Part 5: Q&A Session (5 minutes)

### **Prepared Responses for Common Questions**:

**Q: "What if the blockchain goes down?"**
**A**: *"TML uses multiple blockchains. Bitcoin has 99.98% uptime over 15 years. If one blockchain fails, others continue. Plus, TML has degraded mode - decisions continue, they just queue for later anchoring."*

**Q: "How much does this really cost?"**
**A**: *"$110/month operational cost. Insurance savings alone are $10,000-50,000/month. ROI is over 9,000% in the first month. It literally pays for itself in hours."*

**Q: "What about performance impact?"**
**A**: *"Sacred Zero evaluation: under 10ms. Blockchain anchoring is asynchronous - doesn't slow decisions. Your users won't notice anything except better, fairer treatment."*

**Q: "Is this legally enforceable?"**
**A**: *"Yes. Blockchain evidence is already accepted in courts. The automated penalties are smart contract execution - they're legal obligations. Several law firms specialize in blockchain evidence."*

**Q: "What if we need to customize rules?"**
**A**: *"Fully configurable. Change thresholds, add custom rules, modify penalties. But the core Sacred Zero principles - no discrimination, environmental protection - those are non-negotiable."*

**Q: "Can we try this without commitment?"**
**A**: *"Absolutely. 30-day free trial, full functionality. If you're not saving money and protecting people, we'll refund everything."*
