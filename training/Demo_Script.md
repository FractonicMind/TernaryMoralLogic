## Part 5: Q&A Session (5 minutes)

### **Prepared Responses for Common Questions**:

**Q: "What if the Blockchain goes down?"**
**A**: *"TML employs multiple blockchain networks. Bitcoin maintains 99.98% uptime. Degraded mode allows operation continuation with queued anchoring. The recommended Stewardship Council maintains synchronized copies as additional redundancy."*

**Q: "How much does this cost operationally?"**
**A**: *"Operational costs average approximately $110/month for standard deployment. Stewardship Council participation, when active, provides enhanced oversight with minimal additional cost through distributed infrastructure."*

**Q: "What is the performance impact?"**
**A**: *"Sacred Zero evaluation completes in under 10ms. Blockchain anchoring occurs asynchronously without blocking decisions. Stewardship Council notifications are also asynchronous and don't impact performance."*

**Q: "Is this legally enforceable?"**
**A**: *"Blockchain evidence has established legal precedent. Automated penalty execution uses smart contract infrastructure. The recommended Stewardship Council structure provides institutional validation, with the Human Rights Enforcement Partner coordinating with international mechanisms for enhanced legal standing."*

**Q: "Can rules be customized?"**
**A**: *"Thresholds and parameters are configurable. Core Sacred Zero principles maintain framework integrity. The recommended Stewardship Council, particularly the AI Ethics Research Partner, provides guidance on implementation standards and rule refinement based on empirical research."*

**Q: "How does the Stewardship Council work?"**
**A**: *"The recommended six-member council includes: Technical Custodian (EFF) for repository maintenance, Human Rights Partner (Amnesty International) for enforcement coordination, Earth Protection Partner (Indigenous Environmental Network) for environmental cases, AI Ethics Research Partner (MIT/Stanford) for algorithm validation, Memorial Fund Administrator (Memorial Sloan Kettering) for victim compensation, and an elected Community Representative for stakeholder accountability. Each maintains synchronized logs and provides domain expertise."*
