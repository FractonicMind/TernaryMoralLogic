# TML Blockchain Governance

**Path**: `/governance/blockchain_governance.md`  
**Version**: 2.0.0  
**Architecture**: Mathematical Consensus, No Permission Required
**Quote**: *"Blockchains raise the stone tablet; 46+ frameworks carve the commandments; Guardians are merely the choir—optional, but echoing forever."*

---

## Executive Summary

TML governance operates through **mathematical consensus on immutable blockchains**, not institutional committees. This enables:
- **Immediate deployment** without coordination
- **Automatic enforcement** via smart contracts
- **Tamper-proof evidence** via cryptographic proofs
- **Optional Guardian enhancement** for those who want it later

**No voting. No committees. No permission. Just mathematical truth.**

---

## Core Governance Principles

### Mathematical Authority
- **Blockchain consensus** replaces institutional voting
- **Cryptographic proof** replaces committee approval
- **Smart contracts** replace policy committees
- **Immutable logs** replace meeting minutes

### Deployment Freedom
- **Deploy in 10 minutes** via Docker
- **No institutional coordination** required
- **No approval process** needed
- **Full accountability** from Day 1

### Comprehensive Protection Scope
All governance covers:
1. **Human Discrimination** - Algorithmic bias protection
2. **Human Rights** - 26-document framework enforcement
3. **Earth Protection** - 20+ environmental treaties
4. **Future Generations** - Intergenerational justice

---

## Blockchain Governance Architecture

### Primary Governance Chains
```yaml
Bitcoin:
  role: "Ultimate authority anchor"
  finality: "~60 minutes"
  security: "Highest ($500B+ network value)"
  governance: "Proof of Work consensus"

Polygon:
  role: "Real-time enforcement"
  finality: "~3 seconds"
  throughput: "65,000 TPS"
  governance: "Proof of Stake consensus"

Ethereum:
  role: "Smart contract automation"
  finality: "~15 minutes"
  ecosystem: "Largest smart contract platform"
  governance: "Proof of Stake consensus"
```

### Consensus Requirements
- **Minimum 2 chains** must confirm for validity
- **No single chain** can override others
- **Mathematical proof** supersedes any human decision
- **Automatic enforcement** via smart contracts

---

## Sacred Zero Threshold Governance

### Threshold Definition Sources
**46+ Authoritative Documents**:
```yaml
Human Rights (26 documents):
  - Universal Declaration of Human Rights
  - International Covenants (ICCPR, ICESCR)
  - Convention Against Torture
  - Geneva Conventions
  - Child Rights Convention
  - Disability Rights Convention
  - [Full list in /docs/mandates/human_rights/]

Earth Protection (20+ documents):
  - Paris Agreement
  - Convention on Biological Diversity
  - IPCC Reports
  - Planetary Boundaries Framework
  - Indigenous FPIC Protocols
  - [Full list in /docs/mandates/earth_protection/]
```

### Threshold Updates
**Automatic via Oracles**:
- Treaty changes detected automatically
- Scientific consensus updates pulled
- No committee approval needed
- Cryptographic proof of source

**Manual Override Protection**:
- Cannot weaken below international standards
- All changes logged immutably
- Liability for non-compliance automatic

---

## Investigation and Enforcement

### Blockchain-Based Investigation
**Evidence Access**:
- Anyone can verify logs via blockchain explorers
- Cryptographic proofs publicly available
- No permission needed to investigate
- Whistleblowers can act anonymously

**Evidence Properties**:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be altered after creation
- **Timestamped**: Precise chronology preserved
- **Attributable**: Cryptographically signed
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can validate

### Legal Enforcement
**Automatic Liability**:
```python
if not blockchain.has_valid_log(action_id):
    liability = "STRICT_LIABILITY"
    penalties = "MAXIMUM"
    criminal_charges = "NEGLIGENCE"
    executive_liability = "PERSONAL"
```

**No Committee Needed**:
- Courts read blockchain directly
- Evidence speaks for itself
- Missing logs = guilt presumption
- Smart contracts execute penalties

---

## Smart Contract Automation

### Penalty Execution
```solidity
contract TMLEnforcement {
    function checkCompliance(bytes32 actionId) public {
        if (!hasValidLog(actionId)) {
            // Automatic penalties
            transferPenalty(violator, amount);
            notifyAuthorities(violator);
            updatePublicRecord(violation);
        }
    }
}
```

### Victim Compensation
- **Automatic disbursement** from Memorial Fund
- **No committee approval** required
- **Smart contract triggers** based on evidence
- **Immediate support** for verified harm
