## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Baseline Validation

**Monthly Tasks:**
- Review treaty updates for scientific accuracy
- Validate new IPCC/IUCN assessments
- Verify regional regulation changes
- Certify ecological thresholds

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Comprehensive baseline audit
- Emerging threat assessment
- Threshold adjustment recommendations
- Cross-source conflict resolution

### 2. Trigger Calibration

```python
def calibrate_triggers():
    """
    Council reviews and adjusts Sacred Zero triggers
    based on latest scientific evidence
    """
    review_items = {
        "carbon_budgets": "Annual update per IPCC",
        "tipping_points": "Quarterly risk assessment",
        "biodiversity_thresholds": "IUCN Red List updates",
        "water_stress": "Regional basin analysis",
        "pollution_limits": "WHO/EPA guidelines"
    }
    
    for item in review_items:
        current_threshold = get_current_trigger(item)
        scientific_consensus = council_assessment(item)
        
        if divergence > 10%:
            recommend_adjustment()
            require_supermajority(10/15)
```

### 3. Dispute Resolution

**Scientific Conflicts Protocol:**

1. **Data Source Conflicts**
   - Identify divergent sources
   - Weight by methodology rigor
   - Apply precautionary principle
   - Document uncertainty ranges

2. **Regional vs Global**
   - Local data prioritized for local impacts
   - Global models for systemic risks
   - Synthesis approach when possible
   - Transparency about limitations

3. **Traditional vs Western Science**
   - Equal initial weighting
   - Complementary validation sought
   - Long-term observation valued
   - Both perspectives documented

## Independence Safeguards

  guardian_institutions: 30%
  research_grants: 10%  # Pre-approved sources only

prohibited_funding:
  - Fossil fuel companies
  - Industrial agriculture
  - Mining corporations
  - Conflicted governments

financial_disclosure:
  frequency: annual
  public_access: yes
  audit_requirement: external
```

### Decision Autonomy

- No veto power by Guardian Network
- Recommendations implemented unless 10/11 Guardians object
- Direct communication channel to public
- Whistleblower protections for members

### Conflict of Interest

**Mandatory Recusal:**
- Financial interest in affected industry
- Prior employment (5 years)
- Family members with conflicts
- Active litigation involvement

**Disclosure Requirements:**
- All funding sources (personal and institutional)
- Consulting arrangements
- Board memberships

*All amounts are nominal to 2025 USD

## Integration with TML

### Oracle Network Validation

```python
def validate_oracle_data(source, data):
    """
    Council provides scientific validation 
    for oracle network data
    """
    if source.tier == "GLOBAL_TREATY":
        return council.verify_scientific_basis(data)
    
    if source.tier == "COMMUNITY":
        return council.validate_observation_methodology(data)
    
    if conflict_detected(data):
        return council.resolve_with_evidence(data)
```

### Sacred Zero Oversight

**Council Authority:**
- Recommend new triggers
- Adjust existing thresholds
- Validate community observations
- Certify emergency overrides

**Council Limitations:**
- Cannot remove protections
- Cannot weaken thresholds unilaterally
- Must document all decisions
- Subject to transparency requirements
