# Community Seat Rules: Guardian Network Participation

## Core Principle

Communities are **recognized, not accredited**. The Guardian Network acknowledges existing governance structures rather than imposing external certification. This respects Indigenous sovereignty and local self-determination.

## Community Representation Structure

### Allocation

```yaml
guardian_network_composition:
  total_seats: 11
  distribution:
    environmental_protection: 4
    academic_research: 3
    technical_standards: 2
    civil_society: 2
    
  community_participation:
    within_environmental: 2  # Half of environmental seats
    within_civil_society: 1   # Half of civil society seats
    effective_total: 3        # 27% community voice
```

### Seat Types

#### Direct Community Seats (2)

Reserved for Indigenous and local communities within environmental protection category:

```yaml
indigenous_seat:
  selection: "Rotating regional representation"
  term: "3 years"
  regions:
    - Arctic peoples
    - Amazon basin
    - Pacific islands
    - African communities
    - Asian indigenous
    - Mountain peoples
  
local_community_seat:
  selection: "Frontline affected communities"
  priority:
    - Small island states
    - Drought-affected regions
    - Flood-prone areas
    - Pollution-impacted zones
```

#### Advocacy Seat (1)

Within civil society category:

```yaml
community_advocacy:
  eligible_organizations:
    - Indigenous rights groups
    - Environmental justice organizations
    - Community land trusts
    - Peasant movements
```

## Selection Process

### Recognition Protocol

```python
def recognize_community_representative():
    # Step 1: Community self-nominates
    nomination = {
        "community": "identifier",
        "governance_type": "traditional|modern|hybrid",
        "selection_method": "how_chosen",
        "documentation": "process_proof"
    }
    
    # Step 2: Verify internal process followed
    verification = confirm_community_process(nomination)
    # NOT judging the person, only confirming process
    
    # Step 3: Regional validation
    regional_support = check_neighbor_recognition(nomination)
    
    # Step 4: Guardian confirmation
    if verification and regional_support:
        confirm_seat()  # Simple majority (6/11)
```

### No External Accreditation

**What we DON'T do:**
- Require degrees or certifications
- Impose qualification standards
- Judge traditional governance
- Demand written documentation
- Favor certain governance styles

**What we DO verify:**
- Community actually followed their stated process
- Representative has community support
- No coercion detected
- Basic good faith participation

## Rotation Rules

### Term Limits

```yaml
standard_term: 3_years
maximum_consecutive: 2_terms
lifetime_maximum: 3_terms
mandatory_gap: 3_years  # After max consecutive
```

### Regional Rotation

```yaml
rotation_schedule:
  year_1-3: "Pacific/Asia"
  year_4-6: "Africa/Middle East"  
  year_7-9: "Americas"
  year_10-12: "Arctic/Europe"
  # Then repeat cycle
```

### Emergency Succession

If representative cannot continue:

1. Community names interim replacement
2. Follows their traditional succession
3. Guardian Network rubber-stamps if process followed
4. Full selection for next term

## Rights and Responsibilities

### Full Voting Rights

Community representatives have **equal** voting power:
- All governance decisions
- Sacred Zero threshold setting
- Fund allocation
- Emergency responses

### Unique Authorities

Community seats can uniquely:
- Invoke "Community Witness Override"
- Demand ecosystem-specific review
- Call for traditional knowledge consultation
- Veto actions affecting their direct territory

### Support Provided

```yaml
support_package:
  technical:
    - Secure communication tools
    - Translation services
    - Technical advisors
    - Travel coordination
    
  financial:

    - Community benefit payment
    - Infrastructure support
    
  capacity:
    - Training if requested
    - Youth mentorship program
    - Knowledge exchange
    - Legal support
```

## Community Witness Override

Special power for community seats:

```python
def community_witness_override(decision):
    if affects_indigenous_territory(decision):
        if community_seat_objects():
            decision = "sacred_zero"  # Automatic pause
            
    if traditional_knowledge_contradicts(decision):
        if community_seat_invokes_override():
            require_consultation()  # Mandatory
            
    # Cannot be overruled by majority
    # Expires after 30 days if not resolved
```

## Conflict Resolution

### Between Communities

When communities disagree:

1. Both positions documented equally
2. Regional mediation attempted
3. Sacred Zero maintained during dispute
4. Most protective position prevails

### With Institutional Guardians

```yaml
dispute_resolution:
  stage_1: "Direct dialogue"
  stage_2: "Mediated discussion"
  stage_3: "Full Guardian vote"
  stage_4: "External arbitration"
  
  principle: "Environmental protection wins ties"
```
