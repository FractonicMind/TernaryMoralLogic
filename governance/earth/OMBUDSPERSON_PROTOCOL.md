# Ombudsperson Protocol: Dispute Resolution for Earth Protection

## Purpose

The Ombudsperson serves as neutral arbiter when conflicts arise within communities, between stakeholders, or regarding Sacred Zero decisions. This role ensures disputes don't compromise Earth protection while resolution occurs.

## Core Principles

```yaml
fundamental_rules:
  - Sacred Zero remains active during disputes
  - No single party can override protection
  - Most protective interpretation prevails
  - Resolution timebound to prevent paralysis
  - Full transparency in Always Memory
```

## Ombudsperson Structure

### Selection

```yaml
ombudsperson_pool:
  size: 7  # Global pool
  composition:
    indigenous_law_keepers: 2
    environmental_jurists: 2
    community_mediators: 2
    technical_specialist: 1
    
selection_process:
  nomination: "By Guardian Network"
  confirmation: "8/11 Guardians required"
  term: "5 years"
  removal: "Only for corruption/incapacity"
```

### Independence Guarantees

```python
def ensure_independence():
    protections = {
        "financial": "Funded from Memorial Fund, not parties",
        "tenure": "Cannot be removed for decisions",
        "immunity": "Protected from lawsuits for rulings",
        "resources": "Independent technical advisors",
        "transparency": "All decisions public"
    }
    return protections
```

## Activation Triggers

### Automatic Activation

Ombudsperson activated when:

```yaml
mandatory_triggers:
  - community_governance_deadlock
  - inter_community_water_conflict
  - sacred_site_dispute
  - indigenous_sovereignty_challenge
  - conflicting_ecological_data
  - guardian_vote_tied
  - treaty_interpretation_conflict
```

### Request Activation

Any party can request ombudsperson for:
- Sacred Zero lasting >30 days
- Repeated similar conflicts
- Bad faith claims suspected
- Emergency vs process conflicts

## Dispute Categories

### Category 1: Internal Community

**Timeline**: 30 days maximum

```python
def internal_dispute_protocol(conflict):
    # Day 1-7: Fact finding
    facts = gather_all_positions(conflict.parties)
    
    # Day 8-14: Community consultation
    consultation = engage_traditional_process(conflict.community)
    
    # Day 15-21: Mediation attempt
    mediation = facilitate_dialogue(conflict.parties)
    
    # Day 22-30: Binding decision if needed
    if not mediation.successful:
        decision = ombudsperson_ruling()
        decision.binding_on_all = True
    
    # Sacred Zero continues throughout
    return maintain_protection(decision)
```

### Category 2: Inter-Community

**Timeline**: 45 days maximum

```yaml
process:
  week_1: "Map all affected communities"
  week_2: "Gather positions and evidence"

  week_6: "Final ruling if no agreement"
```

### Category 3: Emergency Override

**Timeline**: 24 hours

```python
def emergency_override_decision(emergency):
    if imminent_threat_to_life:
        # Immediate decision
        ruling = {
            "action": "proceed_with_conditions",
            "documentation": "complete",
            "restoration": "mandatory",

        }
        return implement_immediately(ruling)
```

## Decision Framework

### Hierarchy of Considerations

```yaml
priority_order:
  1: "Irreversible harm prevention"
  2: "Indigenous sovereignty"
  3: "Scientific consensus"
  4: "Traditional knowledge"
  5: "Affected population size"
  6: "Economic factors"  # Always last
```

### Standard of Evidence

```python
def evaluate_evidence(claims):
    evidence_weight = {
        "documented_observations": 0.9,
        "traditional_knowledge": 0.85,
        "peer_reviewed_science": 0.85,
        "community_consensus": 0.8,
        "government_data": 0.6,
        "corporate_studies": 0.4
    }
    
    # Multiple sources required
    if len(claims.sources) < 3:
        return "insufficient_evidence"
    
    # Consistency check
    if contradiction_detected(claims):
        return "apply_precautionary_principle"
```
