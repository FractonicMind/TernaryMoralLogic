# Emergency Council Protocol: Ecological Crisis Response

## Purpose

The Emergency Council activates when ecological crises threaten immediate, widespread, or irreversible harm. It provides rapid response while maintaining Sacred Zero protections, ensuring urgency doesn't override accountability.

## Activation Triggers

### Automatic Activation

```yaml
immediate_triggers:
  - Dam/levee failure imminent (<24 hours)
  - Nuclear facility compromise
  - Chemical plant explosion/leak
  - Wildfire threatening communities
  - Tsunami/earthquake detected
  - Ecosystem collapse in progress
  - Mass species mortality event
  - Drinking water contamination (>10,000 affected)
  - Climate tipping point breached

threshold_activation:
  human_lives_at_risk: 100+
  species_extinction_imminent: IUCN_CR_species
  irreversible_damage_hours: 72
  sacred_sites_threatened: any
```

### Manual Activation

Can be triggered by:
- Any 2 Future Generations Guardians
- Any 3 Guardian Institutions  
- 5 Scientific Advisory Council members
- 100+ community simultaneous alerts
- Ombudsperson declaration

## Council Composition

### Emergency Response Team

```yaml
permanent_members:
  guardian_representative: 1  # Rotating monthly
  scientific_advisor: 1       # On-call specialist
  community_liaison: 1        # Regional representative
  future_generations: 1       # Always included
  technical_lead: 1          # Oracle network coordinator

activation_additions:
  domain_expert: 2           # Specific to crisis type
  affected_community: 2      # Local representatives
  government_liaison: 1      # If required
```

### Decision Authority

```python
def emergency_authority_matrix(crisis_level):
    if crisis_level == "IMMEDIATE":  # <1 hour
        return {
            "decision_makers": 1,  # Single member can act
            "review_required": "within_24_hours",
            "sacred_zero_override": "document_only"
        }
    elif crisis_level == "URGENT":  # 1-24 hours
        return {
            "decision_makers": 3,  # Majority of available
            "review_required": "within_72_hours",
            "sacred_zero_override": "requires_documentation"
        }
    elif crisis_level == "CRITICAL":  # 24-72 hours
        return {
            "decision_makers": 5,  # Full council
            "review_required": "within_week",
            "sacred_zero_override": "requires_justification"
        }
```

## Response Protocols

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (0-1 hour)

```yaml
actions:
  - Pause all non-essential AI operations
  - Activate emergency notification systems
  - Deploy monitoring resources
  - Establish command structure
  - Begin Always Memory crisis log

authority: 
  single_member_sufficient: true
  decisions_provisional: true
  review_mandatory: true
```

### Phase 2: Rapid Assessment (1-6 hours)

```yaml
assessment_checklist:
  - Human life immediate risk
  - Irreversible damage potential
  - Sacred site involvement
  - Community displacement needs
  - Ecological cascade risks
  - Infrastructure dependencies
  
data_gathering:
  - Oracle network emergency mode
  - Community reports prioritized
  - Satellite imagery requested
  - Scientific models activated
```

### Phase 3: Response Coordination (6-24 hours)

```python
def coordinate_response():
    response = {
        "containment": assess_containment_options(),
        "evacuation": plan_if_needed(),
        "ecological_protection": identify_critical_habitats(),
        "resource_allocation": prioritize_by_impact(),
        "communication": unified_messaging()
    }
    
    # Document all decisions
    for decision in response:
        always_memory.log_emergency_decision(decision)
    
    return implementation_plan
```

### Phase 4: Stabilization (24-72 hours)

- Transition to sustained response
- Full Guardian Network briefing
- Community support activation
- Long-term impact assessment
- Restoration planning initiated

## Sacred Zero Modifications

- Dam/levee failure prevention

**Never Permitted for:**
- Economic losses
- Property damage alone
- Political pressure

### Override Documentation

```json
{
  "override_id": "emergency_2025_09_23_001",
  "threat_type": "dam_failure_imminent",
  "lives_at_risk": 3400,
  "sacred_zero_bypassed": ["sacred_site_access"],
  "decision_maker": "emergency_council_member_1",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-23T14:23:45.123Z",

  ],
  "restoration_required": {
    "ceremony": "within_30_days",
    "compensation": "automatic",
    "consultation": "mandatory"
  }
}
```

## Community Integration

### Emergency Communication

```yaml
notification_channels:
  immediate:
    - SMS broadcast
    - Radio emergency system
    - Satellite alert
    - Community sirens
  
  detailed_updates:
    - WhatsApp groups
    - Community liaisons
    - Local language broadcasts
    - Traditional communication trees

offline_communities:
  - Pre-positioned emergency kits
  - Ham radio networks
  - Runner networks activated
  - Smoke signals/traditional methods
```

### Community Authority

During emergencies, affected communities can:
- Veto non-lifesaving AI operations
- Direct local resource allocation
- Override external evacuation orders
- Maintain traditional protection protocols

## Resource Allocation

### Emergency Fund

```yaml
immediate_release: $500K*  # Single member authority
rapid_release: $5M*        # 3 member authority  
major_release: $50M*       # Full council required
catastrophic: unlimited    # Guardian Network vote

*All amounts are nominal to 2025 USD
```

### Resource Priority

1. **Life Safety**: Human evacuation/medical
2. **Irreversible Prevention**: Stop ongoing damage
3. **Sacred Protection**: Religious/cultural sites
4. **Ecological Preservation**: Critical habitats
5. **Infrastructure**: Essential services only
6. **Economic**: Last priority

## Coordination with External Entities

### Government Agencies

```python
def government_coordination(emergency_type):
    if emergency_type in ["nuclear", "dam", "chemical"]:
        notify_regulatory_agencies()
        share_relevant_data()
        maintain_tml_authority()
    
    # TML remains independent
    if government_requests_override:
        require_written_justification()

**Core Principle**: In crisis, speed matters but accountability remains. Emergency powers exist to protect life and prevent irreversible harm, never to bypass protection for convenience.
