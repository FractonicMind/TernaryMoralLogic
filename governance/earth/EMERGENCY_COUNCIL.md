# Emergency Council Protocol: Ecological Crisis Response

## Purpose

The Emergency Council activates when ecological crises threaten immediate, widespread, or irreversible harm. It provides rapid response while maintaining Sacred Zero protections, ensuring urgency doesn't override accountability.

## Activation Triggers

### Automatic Activation (No Vote Required)

```yaml
auto_triggers:
  extinction_event: "Species loss >10% population in 24h"
  climate_tipping: "Feedback loop detection"
  ecosystem_collapse: "75% habitat loss in 72h"
  pollution_catastrophe: "Persistent toxins >LD50 in water supply"
  nuclear_incident: "Radiological release any level"
  genetic_catastrophe: "Gene drive escape laboratory"
  aquifer_poisoning: "Groundwater contamination >50 year cleanup"
  human_rights_emergency: "Rights violation with >100 yr impact"  # ← new
  earth_boundary_breach: "Planetary boundary crossed >recovery"   # ← new
```

### Council Vote Activation

Requires 2/3 vote of available Public Blockchains (minimum 5):

```yaml
vote_triggers:
  threshold_requirements:
    - "Immediate threat to >1000 humans"
    - "Irreversible damage within 7 days"
    - "Ecosystem service collapse risk"
    - "Sacred Zero deadlock >48 hours"
    - "Community emergency declaration"
    - "Blockchain network split"
    - "Human rights emergency <100 yr"     # ← new
    - "Earth protection urgent <50 yr"     # ← new
