# Charter for Future Generations Representation

## Preamble

Those not yet born cannot speak for themselves, yet will inherit the consequences of today's algorithmic decisions. This Charter establishes their formal representation within TML's Public Blockchains, ensuring decisions consider impacts beyond current lifespans.

## Foundational Principle

Every AI decision affecting resources, climate, or ecosystems must consider impacts on humans who will exist 50, 100, and 500 years from now. Their inability to protest today does not diminish their right to a habitable planet.

## Representation Structure

### Custodian Positions

```yaml
future_generations_custodians: 3
allocation:
  youth_representative: 1  # Age 16-25
  indigenous_keeper: 1      # Traditional seventh-generation thinking
  scientific_advocate: 1    # Long-term systems specialist

selection_criteria:
  - Demonstrated long-term thinking
  - No conflicts with extractive industries
  - Published/spoken on intergenerational justice
  - Understanding of compound/cumulative effects
  - Commitment to Human Rights & Earth Protection frameworks
```

### Selection Process

**Youth Representative:**
- Nominated by youth climate organizations
- Rotating between regions every 2 years
- Must demonstrate systemic thinking
- Preference for those already engaged in litigation

**Indigenous Keeper:**
- Selected by Indigenous councils
- Must practice seventh-generation principle
- Rotating among Indigenous nations
- Bridge between traditional and future knowledge

**Scientific Advocate:**
- Earth systems scientist or ecologist
- Specialization in long-term modeling
- No industry funding (10-year lookback)
- Published on irreversible changes

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Temporal Impact Assessment

```python
def assess_future_impact(decision):
    """
    Evaluate decisions across time horizons
    """
    impact_timeline = {
        "immediate": 0-5_years,
        "near_term": 5-25_years,
        "generational": 25-100_years,
        "civilizational": 100-500_years,
        "geological": 500+_years
    }

    for period in impact_timeline:
        if irreversible_damage_detected(period):
            trigger_sacred_zero()
            document_intergenerational_debt()
```

### 2. Cumulative Effect Tracking

Monitor compound impacts invisible in single decisions:

```yaml
cumulative_tracking:
  microplastic_accumulation: "parts_per_million"
  topsoil_depletion: "mm_per_decade"
  aquifer_drawdown: "meters_per_century"
  species_extinction_debt: "committed_losses"
  ocean_acidification: "pH_per_generation"
  genetic_diversity_loss: "percentage_per_century"
```

### 3. Veto Powers

Future Generations Custodians can invoke special veto for:

- Actions creating >100-year cleanup obligations
- Irreversible genetic modifications
- Climate tipping point risks
- Groundwater contamination lasting >50 years
- Nuclear/radiological contamination
- Persistent organic pollutants
- Human-rights irreversibility (e.g., cultural extinction)
- Earth-protection planetary-boundary breach

Veto requires only 2 of 3 Future Custodians (no external voting body).

## Decision Framework

### Intergenerational Justice Principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  1_precautionary: "Uncertainty defaults to protection"
  2_non_depletion: "Leave resources for those who follow"
  3_restoration_debt: "Document what must be repaired"
  4_option_preservation: "Keep future choices open"
  5_burden_shifting: "Don't export problems forward"
  6_human_rights_forward: "Rights travel forward in time"
  7_earth_protection_forward: "Planetary boundaries persist"
```

### Discount Rate Prohibition

**Standard economic discounting PROHIBITED for:**
- Climate impacts
- Biodiversity loss
- Soil depletion
- Water resources
- Genetic heritage
- Human dignity violations
- Ecological tipping points

Future lives valued equally to present lives.

### Irreversibility Scoring

```python
def calculate_irreversibility(action):
    factors = {
        "species_extinction": 1.0,  # Completely irreversible
        "climate_forcing": 0.95,    # Centuries to reverse
        "aquifer_depletion": 0.85,  # Millennia to recharge
        "soil_loss": 0.80,          # Centuries to rebuild
        "forest_loss": 0.60,        # Decades to regrow
        "pollution": 0.40,          # Years to decades
        "cultural_extinction": 1.0,
        "planetary_boundary_cross": 0.95
    }

    if weighted_score > 0.75:
        return "REFUSE"  # Too irreversible
    elif weighted_score > 0.50:
        return "SACRED_ZERO"  # Requires review
    else:
        return "DOCUMENT"  # Proceed with recording
```

## Rights of Future Generations

### Enumerated Rights

1. **Habitable Climate**: <2°C warming, <450ppm CO₂
2. **Biodiversity**: No human-caused extinctions
3. **Clean Water**: Aquifers unpolluted and recharged
4. **Fertile Soil**: Topsoil depth maintained
5. **Genetic Heritage**: Natural genomes preserved
6. **Energy Resources**: Renewable capacity built

3. Full review by all Blockchains required
4. Public disclosure mandatory
5. Cannot be overruled by economic arguments

## Letters to the Future

### Annual Documentation

Each year, Future Custodians write public letter:
- What we protected for you
- What we failed to prevent
- What you must repair
- What wisdom we learned
- What hope we maintain
- What human rights we preserved
- What Earth boundaries we kept

Stored permanently in Always Memory, delivered in 50 years.

## Amendment Process

- Youth council can propose changes
- Indigenous councils consulted
- Scientific review required
- Public comment (90 days)
- Cannot weaken protections
- Cannot shorten time horizons
- Cannot diminish Human Rights forward
- Cannot weaken Earth Protection forward
