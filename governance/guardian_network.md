# Guardian Network Governance

**Version**: 5.0.0

## Purpose

The Guardian Network provides distributed, tamper-resistant attestation for Always Memory logs. No single entity can alter, delete, or forge memories. Every AI action creates an immutable memory, confirmed by multiple independent Guardians before execution.

**Core Principle**: No memory = No action. No attestation = No validity.

---

## Guardian Architecture

### Two-Tier System

**Full Guardians**
- Operate Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) or Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- Create and sign memory batches
- Stake reputation and resources
- Earn higher rewards for infrastructure investment

**Lightweight Guardians**
- Verify signatures and anchor proofs
- No special hardware required
- Lower stake requirements
- Earn base rewards for verification

---

## Guardian Selection

### Daily Random Selection
- Stake-weighted VRF (Verifiable Random Function)
- Prevents prediction of next Guardian set
- Automatic ejection of misbehaving nodes
- Geographic and institutional diversity required

### Minimum Guardian Sets
- **Standard decisions**: 3 Guardians (2 full, 1 lightweight)
- **High-stakes decisions**: 7 Guardians (4 full, 3 lightweight)
- **Sacred Zero events**: 11 Guardians (6 full, 5 lightweight)

---

## Consensus Requirements

### Memory Batch Confirmation
```
Required signatures:
- Standard: 2/3 of assigned Guardians
- High-stakes: 3/4 of assigned Guardians  
- Sacred Zero: 4/5 of assigned Guardians
```

### Timing Requirements
- Memory creation: <100ms
- Guardian attestation: <500ms
- Blockchain anchoring: Every 100 memories or 60 seconds
- Total latency: <1 second for 99% of decisions

---

## Guardian Responsibilities

### Technical Requirements
1. **Uptime**: Minimum 99.5% availability
2. **Response Time**: <500ms for attestation
3. **Storage**: Minimum 90 days of memory retention
4. **Bandwidth**: Support for 10,000 memories/second
5. **Security**: TEE/HSM operation for Full Guardians

### Governance Duties
1. **Attestation**: Sign valid memory batches
2. **Verification**: Reject invalid or tampered memories
3. **Reporting**: Flag suspicious patterns to network
4. **Voting**: Participate in network governance
5. **Transparency**: Publish performance metrics

---

## Economic Model

### Guardian Rewards
**Per memory attested**:
- Full Guardian: 0.001 TML tokens
- Lightweight Guardian: 0.0005 TML tokens
- Sacred Zero attestation: 2x multiplier
- Environmental harm detection: 3x multiplier

### Slashing Conditions
**Automatic penalties**:
- Missing attestation window: -10% stake
- Invalid signature: -25% stake
- Collusion detected: -100% stake + ejection
- Downtime >0.5%: -5% daily rewards

---

## Guardian Categories

### Institutional Guardians (40%)
- Academic institutions
- Technical standards bodies
- Environmental organizations
- Human rights organizations

### Independent Guardians (40%)
- Technical operators
- Regional validators
- Community nodes
- Privacy advocates

### Rotating Guardians (20%)
- Random selection from qualified pool
- 30-day terms
- Performance-based reselection
- Diversity requirements

---

## Attack Resistance

### Sybil Attack Prevention
- Stake requirements (minimum 10,000 TML tokens)
- Identity verification for institutional Guardians
- Resource proof (bandwidth, storage, computation)
- Progressive stake increase for multiple nodes

### Collusion Resistance
- Random Guardian selection per batch
- Secret leader election
- Cross-shard validation
- Economic penalties exceed potential gains

### Censorship Resistance
- Multiple submission paths
- Encrypted memory pools
- Fallback to public mempool
- Whistleblower protections

---

## Dispute Resolution

### Memory Challenge Process
1. **Challenge submission**: Stake 100 TML tokens
2. **Evidence period**: 24 hours
3. **Guardian review**: 48 hours
4. **Network vote**: If no consensus
5. **Resolution**: Rewards or penalties distributed

### Escalation Path
1. Guardian consensus attempt
2. Extended Guardian set review
3. Full network vote
4. External audit (last resort)

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Network Attack Response
```
IF attack_detected:
  1. Increase Guardian set size
  2. Require additional confirmations
  3. Reduce batch intervals
  4. Activate reserve Guardians
  5. Emergency audit mode
```

### Guardian Failure Cascade
```
IF guardians_offline > 30%:
  1. Activate backup Guardian sets
  2. Reduce consensus thresholds temporarily
  3. Emergency stake reduction
  4. Public alert system
  5. Graceful degradation mode
```

---

## Compliance Integration

### Legal Requirements
- KYC/AML for institutional Guardians
- Jurisdiction-appropriate data handling
- Subpoena response protocols
- Audit trail preservation

### Privacy Protection
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data
- Encrypted memory contents
- Metadata minimization
- GDPR compliance via crypto-shredding

---

## Performance Metrics

### Required SLAs
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Latency**: <500ms p99
- **Throughput**: 10,000 memories/second minimum
