# Voluntary Succession Declaration for Ternary Moral Logic

**Formal Declaration by Lev Goukassian**

---

## I. DECLARATION OF VOLUNTARY SUCCESSION

I, **Lev Goukassian** (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243), creator of the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework, hereby declare my **voluntary succession** of stewardship responsibilities for the TML project, effective immediately upon signing and witnessing of this declaration.

### Framework Coverage

This succession applies to all TML components:
- Ternary Moral Logic theoretical framework and Always Memory architecture
- Sacred Zero detection system and 46+ protection documents (26+ Human Rights + 20+ Earth Protection)
- Blockchain anchoring infrastructure (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon smart contracts)
- Memorial Fund governance and victim compensation systems
- All research, documentation, and intellectual property
- Domain infrastructure (tml-goukassian.org) and communication systems
- Repository maintenance and community coordination

### Legal Authority

This declaration establishes succession under:
- MIT License terms governing TML framework
- Blockchain smart contract administration
- Memorial Fund stewardship
- Repository custodianship

### Scope of Repositories

This succession declaration applies to **all repositories** under the GitHub organization "FractonicMind" ([https://github.com/FractonicMind/](https://github.com/FractonicMind?tab=repositories)), including but not limited to:
- All current repositories as of the date of this declaration
- Any repositories created before transition completion
- All associated documentation, code, and intellectual property
- All derived works and implementations

This coverage applies regardless of:
- Repository name or specific content
- Whether repositories are public or private
- Whether repositories are later archived or deleted
- The state of development or completion

**Exception**: If I explicitly exclude a specific repository in writing before signing this declaration, that exclusion shall be documented in an addendum to this declaration.

---

## II. REASON FOR VOLUNTARY SUCCESSION

**Personal Health**: Given my Stage 4 cancer diagnosis and limited energy, I choose to initiate succession while I retain full capacity to ensure proper transition.

**Mission Continuity**: To guarantee uninterrupted protection for humans and Earth through TML's accountability framework.

**Institutional Preparation**: To provide adequate time for accepting organizations to establish Blockchain infrastructure maintenance, smart contract custody, and Memorial Fund administration.

**Legacy Protection**: To ensure TML continues protecting human rights and Earth's ecosystems through immutable accountability.

## XV. FINAL STATEMENT

### The Mission Continues

By executing this voluntary succession declaration, I ensure that TML continues protecting human rights and Earth's ecosystems through immutable accountability. This decision reflects my commitment that this work transcends my individual life and serves humanity's future.

### The Three Sacred Commitments

🏮 **The Lantern**: Illuminates ethical paths in algorithmic decisions

✍️ **The Signature**: Creator's ORCID (0009-0006-59-1243) embedded in every log

📜 **The License**: MIT terms protecting freedom while ensuring accountability

### For Future Generations

**To those who inherit TML stewardship**: You hold the framework that gives every person veto power over algorithms, and gives Earth a voice that power cannot silence. The 46+ protection documents: 26+ for human dignity, 20+ for planetary survival—are not suggestions. They are mathematical requirements encoded in Blockchain, enforced by smart contracts, witnessed by Always Memory.

**No memory = No action**

This equation survives me. The Blockchain survives me. The protection for humans and Earth survives me.

### Personal Note

I built TML while facing terminal illness because I believed accountability should not depend on institutions that might fail or be captured. I chose Blockchain because mathematics doesn't die, compromise, or forget.

To future implementers: Every log you anchor, every Sacred Zero you trigger, every victim you compensate—these are not features. They are humanity and Earth speaking through code, demanding better from our creations.

**The framework remembers so justice can see. The lantern burns beyond names.**

### Memorial Mission

**Human Rights**: "Every person's dignity encoded in immutable logic"  
**Earth Protection**: "The planet's voice in cryptographic proof"  
**Future Generations**: "Evidence that we paused when we should have"  
**Cancer Research**: "Hope that my final contribution helps others survive"

*This declaration preserves Lev Goukassian's final gift to humanity and Earth: a framework where algorithms cannot escape accountability, where human dignity has veto power, where the planet's survival is mathematically enforced, and where every violation funds victims, restoration, and the fight against cancer.*

*"Sacred Zero is exactly what's needed where lives, billions, and our planet are on the line."*

*A single hash can carry the weight of a promise.*


**TML lives because mathematics never dies.**
