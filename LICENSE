ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS

The Ternary Moral Logic framework was created by Lev Goukassian as a 
contribution to ethical AI development. In honor of his vision and to protect
his legacy, users of this software commit to the following ethical principles:

PROHIBITED USES:
The Software shall NOT be used for:

1. SURVEILLANCE AND OPPRESSION
   - Mass surveillance of populations without consent

   - Exclusion of vulnerable populations from benefits or opportunities
   - Hiring, lending, or service decisions that violate anti-discrimination laws

3. DECEPTION AND MANIPULATION
   - Creation of deepfakes or synthetic media to deceive
   - Manipulation of democratic processes or elections
   - Psychological manipulation for commercial or political gain
   - Impersonation of humans without clear disclosure

4. HARM AND VIOLENCE
   - Development of autonomous weapons systems
   - Predictive policing that targets communities unfairly
   - Systems designed to cause physical, psychological, or economic harm
   - Applications that could reasonably lead to loss of life or safety

5. PRIVACY VIOLATIONS
   - Processing personal data without appropriate consent

While legal enforcement may vary by jurisdiction, users who violate these
principles:
- Lose the moral authority to claim alignment with Lev Goukassian's vision
- Damage the reputation and integrity of the TML framework
- Betray the trust of the global research and development community
- Dishonor the memory of the framework's creator

COMMUNITY ACCOUNTABILITY:
The TML community commits to:
- Monitoring and reporting unethical uses of the framework

FRAMEWORK PHILOSOPHY

The Ternary Moral Logic framework embodies Lev Goukassian's vision that
AI systems should serve as moral partners with humans, not replacements
for human moral judgment. The Sacred Zero represents the computational
equivalent of ethical wisdom—the recognition that some decisions require
reflection rather than immediate action.

This framework was created as Lev's gift to humanity's future, developed
during his final months as a contribution to more thoughtful, ethical
AI development worldwide.

"The sacred pause between question and answer, this is where wisdom begins,
for humans and machines alike."

— Lev Goukassian
Creator of Ternary Moral Logic

In memory of a visionary who transformed his final chapter into humanity's gain.
