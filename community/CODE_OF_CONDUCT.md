# Code of Conduct - Ternary Moral Logic Community

---

## Our Sacred Commitment

This community exists to honor and advance Lev Goukassian's vision of ethical AI through the Ternary Moral Logic framework. Just as TML introduces the Sacred Pause for moral reflection in AI systems, we commit to creating a community space that embodies thoughtful, respectful, and ethical interaction among all participants.

> *"The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike."* — Lev Goukassian

We apply the principles of TML to our own community: when faced with conflict or uncertainty, we pause, reflect, and seek wisdom through respectful dialogue.

- Ethnicity, nationality, race, religion, or lack thereof
- Gender identity and expression, sexual orientation
