**Governance Coordination for Ternary Moral Logic Framework**  
**Building on Lev Goukassian's Comprehensive Protection Architecture**

**Founder:** Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)

## Governance Overview

This document establishes the coordination layer for TML framework governance, building upon Lev Goukassian's comprehensive protection and legacy systems. Rather than duplicate existing safeguards, this governance framework integrates and coordinates the sophisticated protection architecture already established.

**Core Integration Points:**
- **Institutional Access:** `protection/institutional-access.md` - Pre-authorized institutions and community review
- **Misuse Prevention:** `protection/misuse-prevention.md` - License revocation and community enforcement  
- **Legacy Preservation:** `protection/legacy-preservation.md` - Memorial fund and perpetual maintenance
- **Integrity Monitoring:** `protection/integrity-monitoring.md` - Cryptographic protection and compliance systems
- **Academic Validation:** `docs/ACADEMIC_VALIDATION.md` - Research validation and peer review framework
- **Ethics Approval:** `docs/ethics_approval.pdf` - Full IRB documentation and ethical compliance

## Governance Philosophy

### Sacred Zero in Governance

Just as the TML framework implements the Sacred Zero for moral complexity, our governance applies deliberate reflection to community decisions. Every governance action honors Lev's vision that AI should enhance rather than replace human wisdom.

### Integration, Not Duplication

This governance framework coordinates existing systems rather than creating parallel structures. Lev's protection architecture is comprehensive and well-designed - governance adds coordination, not redundancy.
