## In Memory of Lev Goukassian

This framework represents Lev Goukassian's final contribution to ethical AI, created during his battle with terminal cancer as a gift to humanity's future. Every contribution to this project honors his vision of AI systems that serve as moral partners, not just moral automatons.

> *"The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike."* — Lev Goukassian

## Welcome Contributors

We welcome contributions from researchers, developers, ethicists, and practitioners who share Lev's vision of more thoughtful, ethical AI decision-making. Whether you're contributing code, research insights, documentation, or real-world applications, your work helps ensure that the Sacred Pause concept continues to evolve and benefit humanity.

### Types of Contributors We Welcome

- **🔬 Researchers**: Theoretical insights, empirical studies, and peer review
- **💻 Developers**: Implementation improvements, new integrations, and tools
- **🎓 Ethicists**: Philosophical perspectives, case studies, and moral analysis
- **🏢 Practitioners**: Real-world applications, feedback, and use cases
- **📚 Educators**: Teaching materials, curriculum development, and student projects
- **🌍 Advocates**: Community building, outreach, and adoption support

---

## Core Principles for Contributors

All contributions must align with Lev's foundational principles:

### 1. The Sacred Pause is Sacred
The deliberate pause for moral reflection is not inefficiency—it's wisdom. Contributions should preserve and enhance this core concept, not bypass it for speed.

### 2. Moral Partnership, Not Automation
TML enables AI systems to be moral partners with humans, not replacements for human moral judgment. Contributions should strengthen human-AI collaboration in ethical reasoning.

### 3. Transparency and Humility
AI systems should clearly communicate their moral reasoning and acknowledge when they need human guidance. Contributions should enhance explainability and appropriate uncertainty.

### 4. Value Pluralism
Respect for diverse moral frameworks and cultural contexts is essential. Contributions should enhance TML's ability to handle different value systems thoughtfully.

### 5. Accessibility and Inclusion
The framework should be accessible to researchers and practitioners worldwide, regardless of resources or technical background.
