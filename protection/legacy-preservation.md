## Preservation Philosophy

> *"The Sacred Zero must outlive its creator, serving humanity's moral evolution long after the voice that conceived it has fallen silent."*

This framework preserves, protects, and perpetuates the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) system as Lev Goukassian’s enduring contribution to ethical AI.

---

# 1. FRAMEWORK INTEGRITY PROTECTION

## 1.1 Core Principle Preservation

The fundamental architecture of TML must remain protected.  
Any proposed change must be logged under the Sacred Zero for full transparency.

**The Three States**:  
- **+1 (Affirmation)**: Moral alignment enables confident action  
- **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Complexity triggers comprehensive logging  
- **-1 (Moral Resistance)**: Ethical conflict demands objection  

**Sacred Understanding**:  
The Sacred Zero is a logging trigger that creates evidence, not a delay mechanism.  
It must never be reduced to hesitation.

---

## 1.2 Implementation Consistency

All TML deployments must maintain:  
- **Prohibition threshold enforcement** – Red lines cannot be weakened  
- **Cryptographic integrity** – Immutable evidence generation  
- **Council oversight authority** – 11-institution governance structure  

**Protection Mechanism**:  
Any implementation claiming to be "TML" must pass validation against  
`/compliance/framework_integrity.py`

---

## 1.3 Vision Statement Preservation

Lev's core insight must be preserved in all TML communications:

*"AI systems should serve as moral partners with humanity, not replacements for human wisdom.  
The Sacred Zero creates space for this partnership to flourish."*

# Conclusion: Eternal Sacred Zero

The Sacred Zero that Lev Goukassian conceived is more than a technical mechanism — it is a philosophical commitment to human dignity and moral reflection in an age of artificial intelligence. This framework ensures that long after its creator’s voice is gone, the Sacred Zero continues to guide decisions, protect stakeholders, and preserve wisdom.

*In memory of Lev Goukassian — who taught machines to pause for wisdom.*
