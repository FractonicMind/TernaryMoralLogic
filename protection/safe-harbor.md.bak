# Ternary Moral Logic — Safe Harbor Provision  
**Accountability with Fairness in AI Integrity Monitoring**

**Framework:** Ternary Moral Logic for Ethical AI Decision-Making  
**Protection Level:** Legal Safe Harbor for Certified Operators  

---

## 1. Purpose
The Safe Harbor clause ensures that organizations fully compliant with TML Integrity Monitoring are protected from unfair liability when failures occur due to external, uncontrollable causes (e.g., cyberattacks, infrastructure outages).  
It balances **strict accountability** with **due process fairness**.

---

## 2. Eligibility for Safe Harbor
An operator qualifies for Safe Harbor only if:  
- **Certification**: System is certified TML-compliant by the Oversight Council.  
- **Controls active**: Integrity Monitor, cryptographic signing, and timestamping were active at time of incident.  
- **Control records present**: Outages, backpressure, or TSA failures are documented in signed control records.  
- **Incident reporting**: Operator submitted an incident report within 72 hours.  
- **Independent audit**: Third-party audit verifies logs, attestation data, and control records.

---

## 3. Scope of Protection
If eligibility conditions are met:  
- **Missing logs** do not automatically create liability.  
- **Burden of proof shifts**: prosecutor must show tampering, negligence, or intentional suppression.  
- **Admissible evidence**: signed control records, ISP outage data, DDoS reports, and TSA failures rebut presumption of guilt.  
- **No penalty** for downtime caused by:  
  - DoS/DDoS attacks,  
  - TSA or anchoring authority failures,  
  - Infrastructure outages beyond operator’s control.  

---

## 4. Limits of Safe Harbor
Safe Harbor does **not** apply if:  
- The certified Integrity Monitor was not running.  
- Control records are missing or falsified.  
- Attribution to Lev Goukassian was stripped or modified.  
- Incidents were concealed or audits obstructed.

---

## 5. Oversight Council Role
- Maintain a registry of certified operators.  
- Review Safe Harbor claims using logs, control records, and forensic data.  
- Issue **binding clearance** if criteria are met.  
- Revoke certification for repeated failures or misrepresentation.  

---

## 6. Legal Standing
- Safe Harbor is a statutory **affirmative defense**: operators may invoke it in court to rebut liability.  
- Fraudulent invocation (e.g., fake outage claims) = **aggravated offense** with enhanced penalties.  
- Accountability is preserved:  
  - **Compliant operators** earn protection.  
  - **Negligent operators** remain fully liable.  

---

## 7. Rationale
- **Without Safe Harbor** → attackers can weaponize DoS to frame operators.  
- **With Safe Harbor** → operators gain fairness, attackers gain nothing.  
- Incentives:  
  - Build strong TML-compliant systems.  
  - Report incidents quickly and transparently.
