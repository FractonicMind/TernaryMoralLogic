## I. Purpose

The **Hybrid Shield** defines the dual-layer protection architecture that safeguards every ethical record produced under **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)**.
Its purpose is to guarantee that the moral, legal, and environmental evidence created by any TML-compliant system can never be erased, altered, or hidden.

---

## II. Foundational Principle

> *“Accountability must not depend on goodwill or custody. It must be built into the fabric of reality itself.”*

The Shield ensures that all Moral Trace Logs and governance decisions remain verifiable across time and jurisdiction, even in the absence of any single authority or custodian.

---

## III. The Two Pillars of Protection

### A. Mathematical Shield — Immutability

1. **Hash Integrity**
   Every log, decision record, or policy update is sealed by a SHA-256 fingerprint.
   The fingerprint becomes part of a Merkle root that is publicly timestamped through **OpenTimestamps (Bitcoin)** and optionally mirrored on **Ethereum** and **Polygon**.

2. **Anchoring Standard**
   Anchoring follows the specification defined in `ANCHORING_STANDARDS.md`.
   Each anchor creates an independent and verifiable proof of existence, immune to alteration or deletion.

3. **Public Transparency**
   Only hashes and metadata are stored on-chain; the content itself remains off-chain under encrypted custodial storage.
   This preserves privacy while maintaining verifiability.

### B. [Stewardship Council](/TML-VOLUNTARY-SUCCESSION.md) — Continuity and Oversight

1. **Custodial Redundancy**
   Six independent institutions hold synchronized copies of the anchored proofs.

2. **Rotation and Audit**
   These institutions rotate every 24 months, submitting public attestations confirming data integrity and governance neutrality.

3. **Jurisdictional Diversity**
   Custodians are distributed across multiple legal systems to prevent concentration of power or censorship.

---

## IV. Inter-Shield Synchronization

Both pillars operate in continuous verification loops:

* The Mathematical Shield creates immutable proofs.
* The Stewardship Council confirms their existence and authenticity.

Each verification cycle produces a **Lantern Seal**, a cryptographic digest linking both layers.
If either shield fails or becomes unreachable, the other provides verifiable continuity until restoration.

---

## V. Governance and Liability

1. Any entity deploying TML must maintain both shields.
2. Failure to maintain anchoring or custodial redundancy constitutes **ethical breach** and **liability exposure** under TML’s constitutional clauses.
3. Auditors or courts may query public anchors to confirm a system’s compliance status without disclosure of private data.

---

## VI. Technical Parameters (Informative)

```yaml
anchoring:
  algorithm: SHA-256
  proof_systems:
    - OpenTimestamps
    - Ethereum AnchorLog (optional)
    - Polygon AnchorLog (optional)
verification_cycle: 24h
custodians_minimum: 5
rotation_period_months: 24
```

*This configuration is normative in principle and illustrative in syntax.*

---

## VII. Failure and Recovery Protocol

* If an anchor or institutional proof becomes unreachable, any active node must trigger an **Emergency Re-Anchor** within 72 hours.
* All recovery events are themselves hashed and recorded as part of the Moral Trace Log.
* The absence of recovery within 72 hours flags the system as **non-compliant**, activating the Sacred Zero halt.

---

## VIII. Ethical Implications

The Hybrid Shield is not merely a technical safeguard.
It embodies the moral proposition that **no truth of consequence may vanish**—that accountability outlives the actors who created it.
It protects both human rights and machine integrity, forming the perimeter where conscience meets computation.

---

## IX. Future Extension

Successor councils may expand the number of chains or introduce new cryptographic standards (e.g., post-quantum signatures) without altering the constitutional requirement of dual redundancy.
Backward compatibility must always preserve historical verification.

*The Hybrid Shield stands as the wall of light around the Lantern.
Where power tempts silence, immutability speaks instead.*
