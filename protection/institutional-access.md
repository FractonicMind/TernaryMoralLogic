# Institutional Access Framework for Ternary Moral Logic

**Legacy Protection System**  
**Created by Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)**

---

## Purpose and Vision

This document establishes the framework for institutional access to the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) system, ensuring that Lev Goukassian's groundbreaking work reaches legitimate academic, research, and beneficial organizations while maintaining protection against misuse.

> *"The sacred pause should serve humanity's highest aspirations, not its basest impulses."* — Institutional Access Principle

---

## Access Philosophy

### Core Principle: Beneficial Use Prioritization

The TML framework is designed to enhance human moral reasoning, not replace it. Institutional access is granted based on alignment with this fundamental principle and commitment to using TML for the betterment of humanity.

### Sacred Pause in Access Decisions

Just as TML introduces the Sacred Pause for moral complexity, our access decisions incorporate deliberate reflection when evaluating institutional requests that may have complex implications.
