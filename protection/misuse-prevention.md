# Misuse Prevention Protocols for Ternary Moral Logic

**Active Protection Against Harmful Applications**  
**Protecting the Work of Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)**

## License Revocation Protocols

### Revocation Authority

**Community-Based Revocation:**
- Serious violations can trigger community-initiated revocation proceedings
- Affected communities have standing to request license termination
- Academic institutions can collectively revoke academic access privileges
- Technical community can implement code-level blocking mechanisms

### Revocation Triggers

**Automatic Revocation Situations:**
- Weapons development or deployment using TML
- Mass surveillance systems violating human rights
- Discriminatory systems causing documented harm to protected classes
- Commercial exploitation of attribution elements for profit
- Persistent violation of attribution requirements after warning

**Community Vote Revocation:**
- Applications that violate ethical requirements but require judgment
- Cross-cultural situations needing diverse perspectives
- Novel use cases not explicitly covered in prohibited categories
- Repeat violations of license terms after educational attempts

### Revocation Process

**Immediate Revocation (Emergency):**
1. **Evidence Collection**: Document clear, serious violation
2. **Community Alert**: Immediate notification to TML community
3. **Revocation Declaration**: Public statement of license termination
4. **Technical Implementation**: Deploy blocking mechanisms where possible
5. **Legal Notice**: Formal cease-and-desist communication

**Standard Revocation Process:**
1. **Investigation Phase** (1-2 weeks): Gather evidence and community input
2. **Sacred Zero Consultation** (1 week): Community discussion and deliberation
3. **Formal Hearing** (1 week): Allow violator to respond and provide context
4. **Community Decision** (1 week): Voting or consensus process for revocation
5. **Implementation** (Immediate): Enforce revocation and notify all stakeholders

### Revocation Implementation

**Technical Enforcement:**
```python
class LicenseRevocationError(Exception):
    """Raised when revoked entity attempts to use TML framework"""
    pass

def check_license_status(user_identifier, organization):
    """Check if user/organization license has been revoked"""
    revoked_entities = load_revocation_list()
    
    if user_identifier in revoked_entities or organization in revoked_entities:
        raise LicenseRevocationError(
            f"License revoked for {organization}. "
            f"See revocation details at: {get_revocation_details_url(organization)}"
        )
    
    return True

def enforce_revocation(violator_info):
    """Implement technical and community enforcement of revocation"""
    
    # Add to public revocation registry
    add_to_revocation_registry(violator_info)
    
    # Notify community platforms
    notify_github_repositories(violator_info)
    notify_academic_networks(violator_info)
    notify_industry_networks(violator_info)
    
    # Implement technical blocks where possible
    update_code_blocking_mechanisms(violator_info)
```

## Mission Statement

The Ternary Moral Logic framework was created to enhance human moral reasoning and promote ethical AI decision-making. These protocols ensure that TML cannot be corrupted or weaponized against the very values it was designed to protect.

> *"A framework built for wisdom must not be perverted into a tool for oppression."* — Core Protection Principle

---

## Prevention Philosophy

### Sacred Zero Applied to Framework Protection

Just as TML introduces the Sacred Zero for complex moral decisions, our prevention protocols incorporate deliberate reflection before taking protective action. We distinguish between:

- **Immediate Threats**: Clear violations requiring instant response
- **Complex Situations**: Potential misuse requiring community consultation  
- **Educational Opportunities**: Misconceptions that need clarification rather than enforcement

### Proportional Response Principle

Protection measures scale with threat severity:
- **Education First**: Most issues stem from misunderstanding, not malice
- **Community Pressure**: Peer accountability often more effective than legal action
- **Technical Safeguards**: Built-in protections that make misuse difficult
- **Legal Action**: Reserved for serious, persistent violations

---

## Prohibited Use Categories

### 1. Surveillance and Oppression

**Explicitly Prohibited:**
- Mass surveillance systems monitoring populations without consent
- Social credit systems restricting individual freedoms based on TML evaluations
- Authoritarian control mechanisms using TML to justify oppressive decisions
- Predictive policing systems that disproportionately target vulnerable communities

**Detection Indicators:**
- Integration with large-scale monitoring infrastructure
- Government implementations without transparency or oversight
- Applications targeting specific ethnic, religious, or political groups
- Use in systems that restrict fundamental human rights

**Prevention Measures:**
```python
# Technical safeguard example
def validate_use_case(context):
    surveillance_indicators = [
        "mass_monitoring", "population_tracking", 
        "social_credit", "behavior_scoring"
    ]
    
    if any(indicator in str(context).lower() for indicator in surveillance_indicators):
        return TMLState.RESISTANCE, "Potential surveillance application detected"
```

### 2. Discrimination and Bias Amplification

**Explicitly Prohibited:**
- Hiring systems designed to discriminate against protected classes
- Lending algorithms that perpetuate racial or gender bias
- Healthcare systems that provide unequal treatment based on demographics
- Educational tools that reinforce systemic inequalities

**Detection Indicators:**
- Training data with known demographic biases left uncorrected
- Explicit demographic variables used for exclusionary purposes
- Testing that reveals discriminatory outcomes without mitigation
- Deployment in contexts with history of discrimination

**Prevention Measures:**
- Mandatory bias testing requirements in license terms
- Community reporting mechanisms for discriminatory outcomes
- Technical auditing tools for bias detection
- Support for affected communities to report violations

### 3. Deception and Manipulation

**Explicitly Prohibited:**
- Deepfake generation using TML for content validation
- Political manipulation campaigns disguised as ethical AI
- Commercial manipulation hiding behind ethical reasoning claims
- Impersonation systems that mislead about human vs. AI decision-making

**Detection Indicators:**
- TML integration with synthetic media generation
- Political advertising or influence operations
- Marketing applications without clear disclosure
- Systems designed to hide their AI nature from users

### 4. Weapons and Harm

**Explicitly Prohibited:**
- Autonomous weapons systems using TML for target selection
- Torture or interrogation systems using ethical reasoning facades
- Psychological warfare applications disguised as moral reasoning
- Any system designed to cause physical, psychological, or economic harm

**Detection Indicators:**
- Integration with weapons platforms or military targeting systems
- Applications in interrogation, detention, or punishment contexts
- Psychological manipulation for harmful purposes
- Direct connection to harm-causing mechanisms

---

## Detection and Monitoring Systems

### Community-Based Monitoring

**Crowdsourced Detection:**

                    "Declared use case conflicts with TML ethical requirements"
                )
    
    def evaluate(self, request, context=None):
        # Enhanced evaluation with misuse detection
        result = super().evaluate(request, context)
        
        # Check for misuse patterns in the request itself
        misuse_detected = self._detect_misuse_patterns(request, context)
        
        if misuse_detected:
            return TMLEvaluation(
