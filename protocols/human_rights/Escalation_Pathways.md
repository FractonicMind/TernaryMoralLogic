# Escalation Pathways: From Detection to Resolution

**Path**: `/protocols/human_rights/Escalation_Pathways.md`  
**Category**: Protocols (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document defines clear escalation procedures from the moment a rights violation is detected through resolution and remedy. Every Sacred Zero trigger and violation detection must follow these pathways, ensuring rapid, appropriate, and accountable responses that prioritize human protection over system efficiency.

## Executive Summary

Escalation is not bureaucracyâ€”it's the rapid mobilization of protection. This framework creates unbreakable chains of responsibility from algorithmic detection to human intervention, ensuring no violation gets lost in the system, no cry for help goes unheard, and no perpetrator escapes accountability.

> "All law must start from the presumption that every human possesses equal and inalienable worth." - Lev Goukassian

## Escalation Principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  speed_over_perfection:
    principle: "Act fast, refine later"
    rationale: "Harm compounds with delay"
    implementation: "Automatic protective measures"
    
  protection_default:
    principle: "When uncertain, protect the vulnerable"
    rationale: "Irreversible harm prevention"
    implementation: "Sacred Zero as default"
    
  human_centered:
    principle: "Affected persons drive response"
    rationale: "Agency and dignity"
    implementation: "Victim choice in remedies"
    
  accountability_chain:
    principle: "Every decision traceable to a human"
    rationale: "No algorithmic scapegoating"
    implementation: "Named responsibility at each level"
    
  transparent_process:
    principle: "Affected parties know status"
    rationale: "Justice must be seen"
    implementation: "Real-time status updates"
```

**Remember**: Escalation is not about passing the buckâ€”it's about rapidly mobilizing the right resources to protect human dignity. Every second counts when rights are being violated. This framework ensures that detection triggers protection, immediately and reliably.
