# Rights Violation Detection: Real-Time Monitoring Framework

**Path**: `/protocols/human_rights/Rights_Violation_Detection.md`  
**Category**: Protocols (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive detection mechanisms for identifying human rights violations in real-time across all AI systems. Detection is not passive observation but active intervention—every violation detected triggers immediate protective responses through Sacred Zero and Always Memory.

## Executive Summary

Rights violations rarely announce themselves. They hide in patterns, lurk in disparities, and disguise themselves as efficiency. This framework creates a multi-layered detection system that catches violations whether they're blatant discrimination or subtle algorithmic drift, individual harm or systemic oppression.

## Detection Architecture

**Remember**: Detection without action is complicity. Every violation we catch but don't stop makes us witnesses to harm. This framework ensures that detection means protection, immediately and absolutely.
