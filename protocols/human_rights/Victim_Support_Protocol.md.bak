# Victim Support Protocol

**Path**: `/protocols/human_rights/Victim_Support_Protocol.md`  
**Category**: Protocols (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This protocol establishes comprehensive support mechanisms for individuals harmed by AI systems under TML jurisdiction, ensuring rapid response, meaningful remedy, and long-term assistance for all victims of algorithmic harm.

## Executive Summary

Victims of algorithmic harm deserve immediate protection, comprehensive support, and meaningful restoration. This protocol ensures no victim stands aloneâ€”from the moment harm is detected through full recovery and systemic reform. Every Sacred Zero trigger activates support, every harm receives remedy, and every victim's dignity is restored.

> "The measure of justice is not in the punishment of perpetrators, but in the healing of victims." - Lev Goukassian
