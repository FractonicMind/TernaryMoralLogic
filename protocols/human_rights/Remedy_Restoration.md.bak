# Remedy Restoration: Making Rights Violations Right

**Path**: `/protocols/human_rights/Remedy_Restoration.md`  
**Category**: Protocols (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive frameworks for remedying human rights violations. Remedy is not charity or goodwill—it's a legal obligation and moral imperative. Every violation triggers mandatory remedy processes that prioritize victim agency, ensure meaningful restoration, and prevent recurrence.

## Executive Summary

When rights are violated, the damage extends beyond the immediate harm—it tears at the fabric of human dignity and social trust. This framework ensures that remedies are swift, substantial, and survivor-centered. We don't just stop the bleeding; we heal the wound and strengthen the body against future injury.

    implementation: "Immediate relief, long-term support"
    timeline: "Hours for urgent, days for standard"
    
  effective_and_adequate:

**Remember**: Remedy is not charity—it's justice. Every violation creates a debt that must be paid in full, with interest. The interest is the systemic change that ensures it never happens again.
