# Whistleblower Protection Protocol

**Path**: `/protocols/human_rights/Whistleblower_Protection.md`  
**Category**: Protocols (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This protocol establishes comprehensive protections for individuals who report violations of human rights, Sacred Zero breaches, or systemic failures within TML systems. Whistleblowers are the immune system of accountabilityâ€”they must be protected, rewarded, and never retaliated against.

## Executive Summary

Whistleblowers risk everything to protect everyone. This framework ensures that those who speak truth to power receive immediate protection, meaningful rewards, and lasting security. Every report triggers automatic safeguards, every retaliation attempt becomes a criminal matter, and every validated disclosure strengthens the entire system.

> "The canary in the coal mine saves the miners. In our digital age, whistleblowers are humanity's early warning system." - Lev Goukassian

#### *"In a world of algorithmic opacity, whistleblowers are the light that pierces through. Protect them, for they protect us all."*

**Remember**: Every whistleblower who steps forward risks their career, their relationships, and sometimes their life to protect others. This protocol ensures that courage is met with protection, truth is met with justice, and those who speak for the voiceless are never silenced.
