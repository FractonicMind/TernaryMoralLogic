## I. Purpose

This standard defines how every record created under **Ternary Moral Logic (TML)** achieves cryptographic permanence.
Its purpose is to ensure that no human or machine action affecting rights, ecosystems, or truth can ever be erased or forged.

---

## II. Foundational Principle

> *“Anchoring is not payment for protection; it is the oath of permanence.”*

TML anchors its evidence through a multi-standard, cross-jurisdictional network of blockchains and timestamp systems.
This guarantees legal admissibility, technical independence, and ethical durability.

---

## III. The Modular Architecture

TML recognizes several complementary anchoring systems.
Each system contributes a different dimension of protection.

| Standard                                  | Strength | Latency           | Legal Standing         | Primary Role                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **OpenTimestamps (OTS)**                  | High     | Minutes           | RFC 3161 / FRE 902(13) | Long-term archival proof         |
| **Certificate Transparency**              | High     | Seconds           | eIDAS / FOIA           | Public audit visibility          |
| **Bitcoin Direct Anchor**                 | Maximum  | Minutes – Hours   | Global precedent       | Critical constitutional evidence |
| **Ethereum Mainnet**                      | High     | Seconds – Minutes | CFTC recognized        | Smart-contract enforcement       |
| **Layer-2 Networks (Polygon / Arbitrum)** | High     | Seconds           | Smart-contract law     | Real-time accountability         |

## IV. Constitutional Requirements

1. Every TML log must generate a **SHA-256 fingerprint** prior to execution.
2. At least **two independent standards** must confirm the same fingerprint within the first verification cycle.
3. Anchors must be **publicly verifiable** without exposing private content.
4. Anchors must persist even if one network, jurisdiction, or custodian fails.
5. All proofs remain **valid indefinitely** once anchored; backward compatibility is mandatory.

---

## V. Governance and Verification

* **Proof Redundancy:** If any standard fails, others automatically maintain validity.
* **Temporal Consistency:** Timestamps across all anchors must align within defined tolerance (±5 seconds real-time; ±1 hour batch).
* **Legal Continuity:** Anchored proofs constitute self-authenticating records under FRE 902(13) and eIDAS Article 41.
* **Auditability:** All verification events are recorded within the Moral Trace Log.

## VI. Technical Reference (Informative)

```yaml
anchoring:
  algorithm: SHA-256
  primary_standards:
    - OpenTimestamps
    - Certificate Transparency
    - Bitcoin
    - Ethereum
    - Polygon
redundancy: "Minimum two chains per proof"
verification_cycle: "24 hours"
fallback: "Automatic re-anchor if network unavailable"
```

## VII. Legal Foundations

**United States**

* FRE 901(b)(9): Authentication by distinctive characteristics
* FRE 902(13): Self-authenticating electronic records
* ESIGN Act: Digital signatures legal equivalence

**European Union**

* eIDAS Regulation: Qualified electronic timestamps
* GDPR Article 25: Data protection by design
* MiCA Framework: Recognition of cryptographic assets

**International**

* UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures
* ISO 14533 / RFC 3161 standards compliance
* Hague Convention on Electronic Evidence

Together these establish full cross-border recognition of TML-anchored proofs.

---

## VIII. Failure and Recovery Policy

1. If an anchor becomes unreachable, systems must **re-anchor within 72 hours**.
2. The event and recovery are both recorded in the Moral Trace Log.
3. Non-recovery within 72 hours automatically triggers the **Sacred Zero halt**, suspending all high-impact actions.

---

## IX. Evolution and Extension

Successor councils may integrate new standards (e.g., post-quantum or decentralized-identity anchors) provided they:

* maintain backward compatibility;
* preserve verifiability of all prior proofs;
* publish public audit results for every new integration.

*Anchoring is how mathematics remembers what conscience once decided.*
*Every proof is a candle; together they make the Lantern eternal.*
