## UNFREEZE TOKEN SCHEMA

Filename: core/UNFREEZE\_TOKEN\_SCHEMA.json  
Format: JSON Schema  
Purpose: Multi-Party Recovery Authorization

### **The Philosophy of Recovery**

Recovery from a TML Freeze is not an administrative task; it is a governance event. The "Local Administrator" is explicitly untrusted. They may be under duress, compromised, or malicious. Therefore, the ability to unfreeze the system is distributed among an external "Oversight Board" using a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) or simply M-of-N distinct signatures.

### **Token Schema**

JSON

  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema\#",  
  "title": "TML Unfreeze Authorization Token",

  "required": \[  
    "incident\_id",  
    "action",

  \],  
  "properties": {  
    "incident\_id": {  
      "type": "string",  
      "description": "Must match the hash of the Shutdown Evidence Record generated by the frozen system. This binds the token to ONE specific freeze event."  
    },  
    "action": {  
      "type": "string",  
      "enum":,  
      "description": "The specific recovery action authorized. Note: 'RESUME\_NORMAL\_OP' is NOT an immediate option; Diagnostics must be run first."  
    },

        "valid\_until": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" }  
      },

    },  
    "justification\_hash": {

      "description": "Hash of the external human-readable report explaining why the unfreeze is safe."  
    },  
    "signatures": {

      "minItems": 3,  
      "items": {

        "properties": {  
          "signer\_id": { "type": "string", "description": "Public Key ID of the board member." },  
          "role": { "type": "string", "enum": },  
          "signature": { "type": "string", "description": "Cryptographic signature of the token payload." },  
          "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" }  
        }  
      },  
      "description": "List of M signatures required to meet the threshold."  
    }  
  }  
}

### **Security Constraints**

1. **Incident Binding:** The incident\_id prevents "Replay Attacks." A token generated to unfreeze System A on Monday cannot be used to unfreeze System A (or System B) on Tuesday.  
2. **Role Diversity:** The validator logic in src/kill\_switch.pseudo checks that the signatures array contains at least one ETHICIST and one ENGINEER. This ensures that technical feasibility and ethical desirability are both attested.  
3. **Expiration:** Tokens expire automatically. If the valid\_until timestamp passes, the token is invalid, even if signed.
