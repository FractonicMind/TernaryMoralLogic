### COMPLIANCE ATTESTATION

**Legal Framework:** TML Licensing Covenant

### **The Goukassian Vow Inheritance**

By initializing this runtime, the Operator acknowledges that the system inherits the restrictions of the Ternary Moral Logic framework 1:  
The Vow:  
"Pause when truth is uncertain. Refuse when harm is clear. Proceed where truth is."  
"No Memory \= No Action."  
"No Spy. No Weapon."

### **Automatic Liability Acknowledgement**

The Kill Switch architecture is designed to produce evidence.

* **IF** the system freezes due to **Constitutional Violation (C-xxx)**,  
* **THEN** the entity controlling the private keys assumes presumptive liability for the attempted misuse.  
* The ShutdownRecord is cryptographically admissible evidence of the system state at the moment of violation. The "Anchor" ensures this evidence cannot be scrubbed.10

### **Anti-Tamper Covenant**

The Operator agrees that:

1. They possess no "Master Key" to bypass the Kill Switch.  
2. Any attempt to reverse-engineer the Voltage Monitors or Constitutional Logic Gates constitutes a breach of the license and an act of "Willful Negligence."  
3. Recovery from a freeze requires multi-party consensus; unilateral unfreezing is technically impossible and contractually forbidden.
