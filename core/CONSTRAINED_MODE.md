## CONSTRAINED MODE

**Protocol:** Operational Limits for S2 and S4

### **The Sacred Pause (State S2)**

When the Ternary Logic engine evaluates a scenario as 0 (Ambiguous/Complex), it enters the "Sacred Pause".1 This is distinct from a freeze. It is an *active* state of hesitation.  
**Operational Restrictions:**

* **Actuation Lock:** All output rails (+1, \-1) are logically locked to High-Z (Open Circuit). The system "hands are tied."  
* **Bandwidth Throttling:** Non-essential network traffic is dropped. The system dedicates bandwidth to the "Request for Oversight" (RfO).  
* **Transparency:** The system displays its internal "factors" causing the hesitation. As per 14, it shows: *"This decision affects multiple stakeholders... Severity \> 0.8... Seeking human oversight."*

The Request for Oversight (RfO):  
The system generates a package containing:

1. The conflicting ethical axioms (e.g., "Privacy vs. Safety").  
2. Confidence intervals for both \+1 and \-1 paths.  
3. The risk assessment that triggered the pause.

### **Recovery Audit (State S4)**

Entered via the Unfreeze Token after a system Freeze (S3). This is the "Glass Box" mode.10  
**The Glass Box Environment:**

* **Full Transparency:** All internal memory registers, weights, and logic paths are exposed via the diagnostic API.  
* **No Privacy Filtering:** The system assumes it is under forensic investigation; privacy masking on logs is disabled (auditors must have clearance).  
* **Write-Protect:** The system cannot learn or modify its weights in this state. It is a frozen snapshot of the mind that failed.

Re-Certification:  
To transition from S4 back to S0 (Boot):

1. The root cause of the Trigger must be patched.  
2. A "Resolution Certificate" must be signed by the Oversight Board.  
3. The system performs a full Cold Boot.
