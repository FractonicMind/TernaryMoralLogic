# The Three-State Problem (Or: How I Learned Banks Can Actually Say "I Don't Know")

**A Memoir from the Most Boring Building in Basel**

---

Let me tell you about the morning I realized that the entire global banking system is held together by the financial equivalent of crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.

It was Thursday, March 14th, 2024. I remember because I was eating a disappointing sandwich while reviewing the latest Basel III compliance reports. (The sandwich was tuna. It's always tuna. This will be important later, trust me.)

I'm the Director of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Yes, that's a real job. No, it's not exciting. Yes, my mother still doesn't understand what I do. "You make rules for banks?" she asks. "Yes, Mom." "And they follow them?" "Well..."

That "well" is the entire problem.

## CHAPTER ONE: IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS FINE (NARRATOR: IT WAS NOT FINE)

The Basel Committee—let's just call it BCBS because typing "Basel Committee on Banking Supervision" repeatedly is how supervillains are born—has been setting global banking standards since 1974. We're the people who came up with Basel I, Basel II, Basel III, and yes, we're absolutely going to make a Basel IV because we're terrible at naming things.

Our job is simple: make sure banks don't blow up the world economy again.

How do we do this? We ask them nicely to follow rules and file reports every quarter saying they definitely followed the rules, pinky promise.

This system works great until you remember that 2008 happened.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Back to the sandwich.

I was on page 47 of a 200-page compliance report from a "globally systemically important bank" (we really need better acronyms—GSIB sounds like a digestive disorder). The report was beautifully formatted. Every metric hit exactly the minimum requirement. Not a single decimal point out of place.

It was perfect.

Too perfect.

Like "this student definitely didn't write their own essay" perfect.

And that's when the email arrived.

## CHAPTER TWO: THE EMAIL THAT MADE ME CHOKE ON TUNA

Subject line: "Ternary Logic (TL) and BIS: Prudence and Proof"

Sender: Lev Goukassian, Independent Researcher

Attachment size: 35 pages

My first thought: *Oh God, not another one.*

You have to understand, I get these emails constantly. Someone's always invented the perfect framework that will solve everything. Usually involving either blockchain, quantum computing, or both. Once someone suggested we regulate banks using astrology. (I wish I was joking. I'm not joking.)

But I was bored. The sandwich was terrible. The compliance report was suspiciously perfect. I opened it.

The first sentence made me put down my sandwich.

The second sentence made me pick up a pen.

By the third page, I was taking notes like a first-year economics student who'd just discovered they actually liked economics.

*"The current global supervisory model operates with an inherent structural limitation: an 'evidence gap.'"*

I stopped reading and stared at my monitor.

Evidence gap.

EVIDENCE. GAP.

Do you know how long we've been dancing around this phrase without actually saying it? Fifteen years. Since 2008. We've written thousands of pages of regulations essentially saying "banks should be good" without any way to verify they're actually being good except asking them "are you being good?"

And they always say yes.

Because of course they say yes.

But this Lev person just... wrote it. Right there in the introduction. "Evidence gap." Like it wasn't the industry's most uncomfortable open secret.

I kept reading.

## CHAPTER THREE: THE THIRD STATE OF FINANCIAL ENLIGHTENMENT

Here's where it gets weird.

This framework—Ternary Logic—is based on a simple but completely insane idea: what if we gave financial systems permission to say "I don't know"?

Not "yes, approve the transaction" or "no, deny the transaction."

But "I don't know if this is safe, please help."

A third state. Zero. Indeterminate. Unknown.

The "Epistemic Hold."

I had to read that section three times because my brain kept rejecting it. It's like showing a binary computer a picture of the color purple. Does not compute.

See, here's what we do now: A bank's algorithm makes a decision. Approve loan. Deny loan. Execute trade. Don't execute trade. Binary. Yes or no. One or zero.

And if the algorithm isn't sure? If it's encountering a situation it's never seen before? If the data is weird and the market conditions are unprecedented and everything feels... off?

Too bad. It picks one. It guesses. It flips a coin. It goes with whichever option seems less wrong.

And then, three months later, we get a quarterly report saying everything went great.

But Ternary Logic says: "What if the system could just... pause?"

What if, when a bank's trading algorithm encounters a situation where its confidence drops below a threshold, it doesn't guess? It just stops. It raises its hand. It says "Um, excuse me, human supervisor? I'm confused and I don't want to accidentally cause a mini flash crash. Could you take a look?"

It's so obvious that I felt personally insulted we hadn't thought of it.

## CHAPTER FOUR: THE EIGHT PILLARS OF "OH NO, THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK"

I'm supposed to be in a meeting about liquidity ratios. I texted my deputy: "Handle it. Emergency."

"What emergency?" she replied.

"Existential," I typed back.

She knows me well enough not to ask follow-up questions.

Because I was on page 12, reading about the "Eight Pillars," and having what my therapist would call "a moment of clarity" and what my cardiologist would call "please reduce your coffee intake."

**The Epistemic Hold** - The pause mechanism. When the system gets confused, it stops.

**Always Memory** - Every single decision, every pause, every moment of uncertainty gets logged. Forever. Immutably.

**Clarifying Questions** - The system doesn't just stop and shrug. It explains WHY it stopped. "I paused because this transaction pattern matches 73% to known fraud cases but also 68% to legitimate bulk orders and I literally cannot decide."

**Hybrid Shield** - Independent validators check that the logs are real and haven't been tampered with. It's like having notaries for your bank's decision-making.

I won't list all eight because this isn't a textbook, but here's what killed me: the **Public Blockchain Anchoring**.

Every log—every decision, every pause, every resolution—gets hashed and anchored to public blockchains.

Bitcoin. Ethereum. The whole crew.

Not the data itself. Just the proof that the data existed and hasn't been changed.

Which means you can't lie about what your algorithm did last quarter.

You can't delete the embarrassing parts.

You can't edit history to make yourself look good.

The math won't let you.

## CHAPTER FIVE: IN WHICH I HAVE A SMALL BREAKDOWN ABOUT TIMESTAMPS

This is the part where I need you to understand something about banking regulation.

Everything—and I mean EVERYTHING—runs on trust.

We trust banks to report accurately.

We trust auditors to audit honestly.

We trust that when a bank says "we followed Basel III capital requirements," they actually did.

We trust because we have no choice. We can't watch every transaction. We can't audit every decision. We're 300 people trying to supervise an entire planet's banking system.

So we rely on reports. Quarterly reports. Annual reports. Attestations. Certifications. Documents saying "we promise we did the thing."

And most of the time, they're telling the truth!

But sometimes... sometimes they're not.

And we find out months or years later, after the damage is done, after the crisis, after the bailouts, after the parliamentary hearings where we have to explain why we didn't catch it.

"Why didn't you know?" they ask.

"Because they didn't tell us," we want to say but can't.

But with Ternary Logic's logging system, they can't NOT tell us.

The logs are automatic. They're immutable. They're timestamped with mathematical precision.

If a bank's algorithm triggered 47 Epistemic Holds in one day because it was confused about market conditions, that's in the record. Forever.

If they resolved those holds by saying "eh, proceed anyway" without proper oversight, that's in the record.

If they tried to delete the logs to hide their incompetence, the blockchain anchoring would catch it.

It's not trust.

It's proof.

MATHEMATICAL. PROOF.

I may have shouted that last part out loud. My secretary knocked on the door to check if I was okay.

"I'm fine!" I called back. "Just having an epiphany about computational verification!"

She's used to this by now.

## CHAPTER SIX: THE PART WHERE I REALIZE WE'RE ALL FRAUDS

Page 22 broke me.

It was the section about the "Evidence Gap" and how the Basel Framework operates on "attestation-based reporting."

Attestation-based.

Which is a fancy way of saying "they tell us they followed the rules and we believe them."

And suddenly I saw our entire regulatory apparatus for what it really is: a very elaborate honor system.

We're not regulators. We're the compliance equivalent of mall security. We have clipboards and official-looking badges but if someone really wants to rob the place, we're mostly just hoping they don't.

The Basel Accords are amazing pieces of work. They really are. Brilliant people spent decades developing these frameworks.

But they're rules without enforcement.

Guidelines without verification.

Principles without proof.

We wrote a cookbook for banking safety and then trusted banks to follow the recipes without ever tasting the food.

And this independent researcher—probably working from a home office, possibly in pajamas—had just casually described a system that would let us verify every ingredient.

## CHAPTER SEVEN: MODEL 3 WILL HAUNT MY DREAMS

The paper described three possible implementation models:

**Model 1:** Individual banks voluntarily adopt TL as an internal governance tool.

**Model 2:** BIS and Basel Committee integrate TL into official supervisory frameworks.

**Model 3:** A global, autonomous protocol that operates above nation-states.

Model 3 made me need to lie down.

A universal financial verification protocol. No borders. No jurisdictions. Just math.

Every bank. Every transaction. Every moment of uncertainty. All logged. All verified. All immutable.

It would make the current system look like we're regulating banks with carrier pigeons and papyrus.

It would also require every nation on Earth to agree to surrender a chunk of financial sovereignty to a mathematical protocol.

Which... yeah. That's not happening. Not in my lifetime.

But Model 1? Banks adopting it voluntarily because it reduces their audit costs and improves regulator confidence?

That could happen tomorrow.

Model 2? Us integrating it into Basel IV or whatever we're calling the next iteration?

That's just good governance.

## CHAPTER EIGHT: THE EMAIL I SENT AT 11:47 PM

I stayed late. Obviously I stayed late. I'd just discovered that the entire field I'd dedicated my career to had been operating on an honor system and someone had invented the actual enforcement mechanism.

I drafted an email to Lev Goukassian. Deleted it. Drafted another. Deleted that too.

How do you respond to someone who's just solved your life's work?

Eventually I settled on:

"Dear Mr. Goukassian,

Thank you for your paper on Ternary Logic and its application to BIS frameworks. I have several questions, most of which boil down to 'why didn't we think of this' and 'how quickly can we implement this.'

Would you be available for a call next week?

Also: The Epistemic Hold concept is brilliant. We've been trying to enforce 'appropriate hesitation' in algorithmic trading for years. You've just shown us how to make hesitation a feature instead of a bug.

Regards,
Someone Who Should Have Thought of This First"

I hit send at 11:47 PM.

He replied at 6:23 AM: "Happy to talk. Also, I appreciate that you read all 35 pages. Most people give up around page 8."

I laughed out loud in my empty office.

## CHAPTER NINE: THE MEETING THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Three weeks later, I was in a room with representatives from 15 central banks, explaining Ternary Logic to people who regulate trillions of dollars.

"So it's a pause button," said the representative from the Deutsche Bundesbank.

"It's an AUTOMATIC pause button," I corrected. "That explains WHY it paused. And logs the pause immutably. And requires human oversight. And generates proof of compliance."

"So it's a very fancy pause button."

"It's the fanciest pause button in the history of finance."

"I'll be honest," said the Bank of England representative, "I came here expecting to hate this. But I've read the paper twice. The math checks out. The implementation is feasible. The governance model is sound."

"The question," said someone from the Fed, "is whether banks will adopt it."

"The question," I corrected, "is whether we can afford NOT to mandate it."

Silence.

Then: "Draft a proposal for Basel Committee review."

"Already done," I said, pulling out a 60-page document. "I've been working on it for three weeks. Couldn't sleep. Kept thinking about evidence gaps."

## EPILOGUE: ONE YEAR LATER

The BIS Innovation Hub is running a pilot project. Three banks. Six months. Full Ternary Logic implementation.

The results are... remarkable.

One bank's algorithm triggered 342 Epistemic Holds in the first month. 342 times it said "I'm not confident about this decision, please review."

Of those 342, human reviewers determined that 89 would have resulted in compliance violations.

89 violations prevented.

Not discovered after the fact.

Not punished retroactively.

Not covered up and reported as successes.

PREVENTED.

Because the system knew it didn't know.

And it asked for help.

The Basel Committee is drafting new guidance. "Incorporating Automated Hesitation Mechanisms into Risk Management Frameworks."

We're terrible at naming things, but we're getting better at building them.

And all because one independent researcher sent an email at 6:47 in the morning saying "hey, what if banks could say 'I don't know'?"

Lev Goukassian, if you're reading this: your paper gave the global banking system permission to be uncertain. And in that uncertainty, we found the path to actual certainty.

Also, I finally got a better sandwich place. The tuna situation has been resolved.

Thank you.

**AUTHOR'S NOTE:** This story is fictional, except for the part about the evidence gap, which is painfully real. The Basel Framework is real and impressive. The compliance system is real and has gaps. Ternary Logic is real and might just fill them. If you regulate anything and haven't considered three-state logic, you might want to ask yourself why you're still using binary systems to model a non-binary world.

**WORD COUNT:** 2,847 words of regulatory enlightenment and sandwich complaints

**FINAL THOUGHT:** Somewhere in Basel, right now, someone is reading a compliance report and wondering if the bank is telling the truth. This story is for them. May they discover the Epistemic Hold.
