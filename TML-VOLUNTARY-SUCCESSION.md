**Abstract:** This paper outlines a formal succession plan for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework, an open-source system designed to enforce immutable ethical constraints on artificial intelligence and automated systems. Motivated by the author's terminal health diagnosis, this document details a decentralized, multi-stakeholder governance model intended to ensure the long-term viability and integrity of the TML project. The framework proposes a "Stewardship Council" composed of leading non-profit organizations in technology, human rights, and environmental protection to oversee the system's core components, including its blockchain-anchored record-keeping, smart contract-based enforcement, and a victim compensation fund. The paper serves as both a legal declaration and a call to action for institutions to assume custodianship, ensuring the continuity of a public good designed for algorithmic accountability.

### **1. Introduction**

The increasing autonomy of algorithmic systems presents a significant challenge to societal governance and ethical oversight. When these systems cause harm, traditional accountability mechanisms often prove inadequate due to opaque decision-making processes and distributed responsibility. The Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework was developed as an open-source, technically robust solution to this problem, creating a system of prior restraint and immutable auditing for automated actions.  
This paper presents the formal succession plan for the TML project. The author, facing a terminal illness, has initiated this process to transition stewardship of the framework to a consortium of institutions capable of preserving its mission. This document details the core architectural principles of TML and proposes a durable, decentralized governance structure to guide its future. The objective is to establish a model for the long-term maintenance of public-interest technology projects, ensuring they can outlive their creators.

### **2. The Ternary Moral Logic Framework: Core Components**

TML is built on a foundation of mandatory transparency and non-negotiable ethical constraints, enforced through cryptographic and economic incentives. Its critical infrastructure comprises four key elements:  

**2.1 Always Memory Architecture:** TML mandates that any significant automated action must be preceded by the creation of an immutable log. This "pre-action" log, detailing the intended operation and its justification, is cryptographically anchored to a public blockchain. This principle of "no memory, no action" ensures a permanent and auditable trail exists before any potential harm can occur.  

**2.2 Sacred Zero and the 46+ Protection Documents:** The framework incorporates a fail-safe mechanism known as "Sacred Zero." This system is designed to automatically halt any process that an analysis predicts will violate one of 46+ foundational legal and ethical documents. This corpus includes 26+ core international human rights treaties (e.g., the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Geneva Conventions) and over 20+ international environmental protection agreements (e.g., the Paris Agreement, Convention on Biological Diversity).  

**2.3 Multi-Chain Infrastructure and Smart Contract Enforcement:** To ensure public verifiability and censorship resistance, TML anchors its logs across multiple public blockchains, including Bitcoin (via OpenTimestamps), Ethereum, and Polygon. Enforcement is automated through smart contracts that manage penalties for violations, distribute whistleblower rewards, and trigger automated compensation to victims.  

**2.4 The Memorial Fund:** Penalties collected from framework violations are automatically allocated to a "Memorial Fund." The distribution is permanently encoded: 40% to victims of AI-driven harm, 30% to environmental restoration projects, 15% to whistleblowers who report violations, and the remaining 15% to framework operations and computational cancer research.

### **3. Proposed Governance and Succession Model**

To prevent capture and ensure long-term alignment with its public-interest mission, TML's governance is designed to be decentralized. A multi-organization **Stewardship Council** is proposed, with each member holding specific, non-overlapping responsibilities. No single organization can control the framework.  

**3.1 Stewardship Council Composition:** The proposed council structure allocates seats to specialists in key domains:

* **Primary Technical Custodian (Recommended: Electronic Frontier Foundation):** Responsible for the open-source repository, blockchain infrastructure, and technical community support.  
* **Human Rights Enforcement Partner (Recommended: Amnesty International):** Responsible for monitoring the enforcement of the 26+ human rights documents and coordinating victim support.  
* **Earth Protection Enforcement Partner (Recommended: Indigenous Environmental Network):** Responsible for monitoring the enforcement of the 20+ environmental treaties.  
* **AI Ethics Research Partner (Recommended: MIT Media Lab or Stanford HAI):** Responsible for guiding future research and the evolution of implementation standards.  
* **Memorial Fund Administrator (Recommended: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center):** Responsible for administering the cancer research portion of the Memorial Fund.  
* **Community Representative:** An elected position to represent the interests of implementers and the broader user community.

**3.2 Governance Limitations:** The Council's power is constitutionally limited. It cannot modify the framework's open-source MIT License, alter the Memorial Fund's distribution percentages, or remove any of the 46+ core protection documents. Major changes require a 5/6 consensus.  

**3.3 Transition Plan:** The succession is structured in a 180-day, four-phase process:

1. **Notification (Days 1-30):** Public announcement and formal notification to recommended custodian organizations.  
2. **Organization Response (Days 31-90):** Evaluation of proposals from potential custodians.  
3. **Transition Preparation (Days 91-150):** Technical and knowledge transfer.  
4. **Operational Handoff (Days 151-180):** Final transfer of all assets and responsibilities.

### **4. Conclusion**

The TML succession plan represents a deliberate effort to solve the governance problem for critical digital infrastructure. By distributing stewardship among expert organizations and binding them with immutable, on-chain rules, the framework is designed to persist and function independently of any single individual or entity. It offers a transparent, enforceable, and durable model for algorithmic accountability. This document is a formal invitation to the recommended institutions and the broader digital rights, human rights, and environmental communities to engage in this succession process and carry the mission forward. The framework remembers so that justice can see.
