# Legal Summary — TML Enforcement Framework

### I. Overview

This summary explains how the **legal_provisions** directory interfaces with the broader Ternary Moral Logic (TML) architecture.
It shows how moral accountability (TML’s pillars) transitions into legal enforceability (motions, orders, and evidence).

### II. Structural Map

| Category            | File                           | Function                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Procedural Motion   | `MOTION_STRUCTURED_LOGGING.md` | Initiates judicial enforcement; requests structured AI logs and neutral custodian. |
| Judicial Order      | `COURT_ORDER_TEMPLATE.md`      | Court-ready order granting the motion.                                             |
| Evidence Management | `EVIDENCE_CHAIN_GUIDE.md`      | Ensures proofs and logs meet legal admissibility standards.                        |
| Governance Overview | `README.md`                    | Defines purpose and scope of the directory.                                        |

### III. Link to Core TML Pillars

| TML Pillar             | Legal Translation                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Always Memory**      | Preservation of immutable logs and chain-of-custody requirements.  |
| **Moral Trace Logs**   | Structured schema ensuring deliberation is recorded, not inferred. |
| **Hybrid Shield**      | Cryptographic anchoring and multi-chain verification.              |
| **Goukassian Promise** | Legal reflection of accountability and ethical duty.               |

### IV. Intended Use

* Serve as **ready-to-file prototypes** in judicial, regulatory, or academic contexts.
* Provide a **reference corpus** for legal counsel when formalizing AI accountability statutes.
* Offer a **bridge** between computer-science immutability and evidentiary law.

### V. Preservation

All documents in this directory are to be **anchored and logged** in `/proofs/ANCHOR_LOG.md` and **notarized** through OpenTimestamps for integrity verification.
