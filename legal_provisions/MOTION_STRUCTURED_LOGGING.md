# Motion for Structured Immutable Logging and Appointment of Neutral Custodian

### UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

*(or appropriate jurisdiction)*

**MOTION FOR ORDER REQUIRING STRUCTURED IMMUTABLE LOGGING AND APPOINTMENT OF NEUTRAL CUSTODIAN**

**NOW COMES** the Petitioner, by counsel, and respectfully moves this Court for an order requiring the Respondent to produce and preserve all artificial-intelligence decision logs in a **structured, verifiable format** consistent with accepted standards for forensic auditability and transparency.

---

### I. Purpose

To ensure that AI-generated actions and outputs can be meaningfully reviewed for intent, bias, and compliance, Petitioner requests that the Court specify the **minimum schema** of data fields to be preserved and appoint an independent **Neutral Custodian** to receive, validate, and maintain said records under seal.

---

### II. Required Log Schema

Each recorded event shall include, at minimum:

1. `event_id` – unique identifier
2. `timestamp` – UTC time of execution
3. `input_context_span` – relevant input data and prompt segment
4. `alternatives_considered` – candidate paths or responses evaluated
5. `chosen_path` – final output or decision rendered
6. `confidence_scores` – probabilistic metrics or model certainty
7. `invoked_policy_ids` – ethical or operational rules applied
8. `human_review_flag` – indicator of human oversight, if any
9. `annotation_summary` – rationale or explanatory commentary
10. `hash_anchor` – cryptographic seal linking the record to immutable chain storage

---

### III. Neutral Custodian

Petitioner further requests the Court to appoint a **Neutral Custodian**—an independent technical expert or certified forensic laboratory—to:

* Receive and verify raw logs directly from Respondent systems;
* Validate cryptographic integrity and completeness;
* Produce redacted, human-readable summaries for judicial review;
* Maintain custody under protective order to preserve trade secrets while ensuring evidentiary reliability.

---

### IV. Relief Requested

Petitioner prays that the Court issue an order:

1. Mandating the structured schema above for all future AI-system logging and discovery production;
2. Appointing a Neutral Custodian as described;
3. Establishing sanctions for non-compliance or production of unusable, unstructured, or unverifiable data.

**Respectfully submitted,**

A record without a reason is merely noise in time; a record with a reason becomes truth in motion.
