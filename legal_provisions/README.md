# **Legal Provisions — Overview**

### Purpose

This directory contains **pre-drafted legal instruments** for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework.
These templates outline how accountability, discovery, and evidentiary processes can be enforced in courts or regulatory proceedings.

### Scope

The files here are **not filed motions** or active legal pleadings.
They serve as **ready-to-file prototypes** demonstrating how TML’s governance architecture translates into enforceable legal form.

### Contents

* **MOTION_STRUCTURED_LOGGING.md** — one-page motion requesting structured AI logs and neutral custodian.
* **COURT_ORDER_TEMPLATE.md** — proposed order granting the motion.
* **EVIDENCE_CHAIN_GUIDE.md** — guide for validating and presenting notarized proofs in court.
* *(Future additions may include procedural annexes, amicus briefs, or certification standards.)*

### Relation to `/proofs/`

`/proofs/` stores notarized and cryptographically anchored evidence.
`/legal_provisions/` defines **how that evidence is used and protected** within legal systems.
Together they form the **accountability chain**:
**Architecture → Proof → Enforcement.**

### Disclaimer

All files are intellectual and procedural frameworks, not legal advice.
Future legal counsel may adapt them for jurisdiction-specific filings.
