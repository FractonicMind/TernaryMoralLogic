**Purpose:**
Explain how to validate, anchor, and present notarized files (from `/proofs/`) so they hold up in court or regulatory review. This guide turns your cryptographic artifacts into admissible evidence.

Hereâ€™s the structure for it:

---

# **Evidence Chain Guide**

### I. Purpose

This document establishes the standard operating procedure for verifying and presenting immutable logs and notarized proofs created under the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework. It bridges the technical anchoring process with legal evidentiary requirements.

---

### II. Chain of Custody Principles

1. **Continuity:** Every document must trace its lineage from creation to court submission.
2. **Integrity:** Each file must include or reference a SHA-256 hash anchored via OpenTimestamps or blockchain ledger (Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Polygon).
3. **Authenticity:** The anchored hash must correspond to a notarized artifact listed in `/proofs/ANCHOR_LOG.md`.
4. **Transparency:** Any redaction for trade secret protection must be documented and provably non-altering (e.g., zero-knowledge or Merkle proof).

---

### III. Verification Steps

1. **Hash Verification:**

   * Run `sha256sum filename` locally.
   * Match against the recorded hash in `ANCHOR_LOG.md`.
2. **Timestamp Verification:**

   * Submit `.ots` file to OpenTimestamps client or web verifier.
   * Confirm blockchain confirmation and match transaction ID.
3. **Cross-reference:**

   * Ensure notarized PDF and its `.ots` file share identical SHA-256.
4. **Audit Trail Documentation:**

   * Record verification date, verifying party, and signature in `TML_Notarized_Manifest.txt`.

---

### IV. Legal Admissibility Notes

* Logs and notarized proofs qualify as **self-authenticating digital evidence** under Federal Rule of Evidence 902(13).
* Each notarized proof demonstrates that the artifact existed in its current form at or before the blockchain confirmation date.
* Cryptographic attestation **does not** disclose content; it verifies immutability.

---

### V. Presentation in Court

1. **Submit exhibits** as notarized PDFs with accompanying `.ots` proofs.
2. **Provide verification summary** (one paragraph citing SHA-256, timestamp, and verification date).
3. **Append anchor transaction links** in the record of exhibits.

---

### VI. Maintenance

* Update `ANCHOR_LOG.md` upon every notarization.
* Store redundant copies on decentralized storage or institutional nodes.
* Annual verification and renewal recommended.

---

#### *Evidence must not only exist; it must prove it never changed.* **-Lev Goukassian**
