# Human Rights Attestations and Certifications

**Path**: `/compliance/human_rights/Attestations_Human_Rights.md`  
**Category**: Compliance (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory attestation requirements for human rights compliance within TML systems. Every operator, developer, and governance body must provide cryptographically signed attestations confirming their understanding, implementation, and ongoing adherence to human rights obligations.

## Executive Summary

Attestations transform promises into accountability. This framework requires regular, legally binding certifications from every level of the organizationâ€”from individual developers to board directors. Each attestation becomes an immutable record in Always Memory, creating personal liability for human rights violations and establishing clear chains of responsibility.

> "A signature is a promise written in permanence. In the age of AI, every attestation is a vow to humanity." - Lev Goukassian
