# Human Rights Audit Framework

**Path**: `/compliance/human_rights/Human_Rights_Audit.md`  
**Category**: Compliance (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-26

## Purpose

This document establishes the comprehensive audit framework for evaluating TML system compliance with human rights obligations, Sacred Zero triggers, and dignity preservation measures. Every audit creates immutable evidence of human rights performance, identifies systemic issues, and mandates corrective actions.

## Executive Summary

Human rights auditing is not a checkbox exercise—it's the systematic verification that every algorithm respects human dignity. This framework ensures continuous monitoring, periodic deep assessment, and immediate response to violations. Every audit trail becomes part of Always Memory, every finding triggers reform, and every recommendation is legally binding.

> "An unaudited algorithm is an unchecked power. In the age of AI, human rights audit is not compliance—it's conscience." - Lev Goukassian

**Remember**: Every audit is an opportunity to strengthen human rights protection. The goal is not to pass the audit but to continuously improve our respect for human dignity. Audits reveal what metrics alone cannot: the human impact of our algorithms.
