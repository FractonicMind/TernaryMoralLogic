## Purpose

This document details the Human Rights Division of the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund, specifically focused on supporting victims of algorithmic discrimination, AI-driven human rights violations, and systemic digital injustice. Every Sacred Zero trigger that protects human dignity creates a pathway to meaningful support.

## Executive Summary

The Human Rights Division ensures that victims of AI harm receive immediate support, comprehensive remedy, and long-term restoration. Operating with 40% of the Memorial Fund's resources, this division transforms enforcement penalties into human healing, turning corporate accountability into individual recovery.

> "Every algorithm that harms a human creates a debt to humanity. The Memorial Fund ensures that debt is paidâ€”not just in penalties, but in healing." - Lev Goukassian

#### *"The Memorial Fund transforms corporate penalties into human healing. Every dollar collected from violators becomes hope for victims. This is justice made tangible."*

**Remember**: Behind every fund disbursement is a human being rebuilding their life after algorithmic harm. The Memorial Fund ensures that no victim faces recovery alone, that every harm receives remedy, and that patterns of violation create resources for prevention.
