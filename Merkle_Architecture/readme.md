# TML Merkle Architecture: The Cryptographic Backbone

## Overview
This repository contains the definitive technical and strategic documentation for the **Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Merkle Architecture**.

In TML, the Merkle tree is not merely a logging optimization; it is the **structural enforcement layer** of the system's ethical logic. It transforms the "Sacred Zero" (Epistemic Hold) from a philosophical concept into an immutable cryptographic state. By binding every AI inference to a "Moral Trace Log" before action execution, this architecture enforces the core axiom: **"No Log = No Action"**.

### Core Capabilities
* **Contextual Integrity:** Enforced via the **Active Axiom Set Hash**, which cryptographically binds every decision to the exact governance rules active at that millisecond.
* **Adversarial Resilience:** hardened against insider threats, retroactive reinterpretation, and log truncation via "Execution Interlocks".
* **Scalable Verification:** Utilizes a **Ternary (Base-3)** topology to map TML's triadic states (+1, 0, -1), optimizing proof sizes for intergenerational audit.

### Visual Architecture

**1. Hierarchical Domain Separation**
The TML Merkle Root aggregates independent subtrees for Human Rights, Earth Protection, and Governance, ensuring domain-specific integrity.

**2. Lightweight Verification (SPV)**
Regulators can verify individual events using Simple Payment Verification (SPV) without downloading the full blockchain ledger.

## Documentation Index

This folder contains the complete architectural suite, segmented by audience and technical depth.

### 1. The Executive Strategy (Overview)
**Filename:** `TML_Merkle_Architecture_Overview`
* **Formats:** `.md`, `.html`, `.mp3` (Audio Deep Dive)
* **Purpose:** This is the strategic introduction. It explains *why* the Merkle tree is non-optional for TML's ethical guarantees. It details how the structure prevents "moral drift" and enables the "Hybrid Shield" governance model.
* **Audience:** Executives, Policy Makers, Non-Technical Stakeholders.
* **Key Concept:** The "collapse conditions" of TML if Merkle structures are removed.

### 2. The Engineering Blueprint (Specification)
**Filename:** `TML_Merkle_Protocol_Specification`
* **Formats:** `.md`, `.html`
* **Purpose:** The implementation "Source of Truth" for developers. It defines the **Canonical Leaf Node Schema**, mandatory fields (e.g., UUIDv7, Trusted Timestamp), and specific cryptographic primitives (BLAKE3-256). It also details the Data Availability (DA) strategy and storage tiers.
* **Audience:** Systems Engineers, Backend Developers, DevOps.
* **Key Concept:** The rigorous schema definition and "Active Axiom Set Hash" implementation.

### 3. The Threat Model (Security)
**Filename:** `TML_Adversarial_Security_Hardening`
* **Formats:** `.md`, `.html`, `.mp3` (Audio Deep Dive)
* **Purpose:** A defensive analysis focusing on how the system survives hostility. It details the **Execution Interlock** (hardware enforcement), **Crypto-Shredding** (GDPR compliance), and protection against retroactive reinterpretation. It assumes a "Zero Trust" environment.
* **Audience:** Security Auditors, Cryptographers, Regulators.
* **Key Concept:** The "Causal Integrity Enforcement" preventing silent bypass of the Sacred Zero.

### 4. The Academic Proof (Research)
**Filename:** `TML_Cryptographic_Imperative_Research`
* **Formats:** `.md`, `.html`
* **Purpose:** A formal research report providing mathematical justification for the architecture. It includes a comparative analysis against Bitcoin and Ethereum structures and proves the efficiency gains of the **Ternary** tree topology (35% reduction in depth vs. binary).
* **Audience:** Academic Researchers, Governance Institutions, IEEE/SSRN Reviewers.
* **Key Concept:** The information-theoretic optimality of Ternary trees for TML's triadic logic.
