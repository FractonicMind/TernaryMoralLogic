        "inheritable": True,  # By community, not individual
        "expiry": None,
        "monetary_value": 0
    }
    
    def calculate_earned(self, activity):
        base_rewards = {
            "verified_observation": 10,
            "critical_alert": 50,
            "training_completed": 20,
            "youth_mentorship": 30,
            "consistent_monitoring": 15  # Monthly bonus
        }
