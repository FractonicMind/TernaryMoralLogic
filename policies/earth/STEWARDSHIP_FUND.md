        "inheritable": True,  # By community, not individual
        "expiry": None,
        "monetary_value": 0
    }
    
    def calculate_earned(self, activity):
        base_rewards = {
            "verified_observation": 10,
            "critical_alert": 50,
            "training_completed": 20,
            "youth_mentorship": 30,
            "consistent_monitoring": 15  # Monthly bonus
        }
        return base_rewards.get(activity, 0)

    year_10_projection = calculate_compound_growth(initial, growth_rates, 10)
    
    return {
        "total_fund": 150_000_000,
        "annual_disbursement": 60_000_000,
