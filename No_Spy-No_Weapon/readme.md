# **Ternary Moral Logic Core Architecture**

Welcome to the foundational repository for Ternary Moral Logic. This folder contains the complete doctrinal research, geopolitical analysis, and executable architectural blueprints required to enforce ethical AI compliance at the fundamental computational level.

## **The Dual Mandates**

This repository operationalizes two absolute structural invariants:

* **No Spy, No Weapon**: A categorical prohibition on mass civilian surveillance, lethal targeting, and autonomous weapon systems.  
* **No Log \= No Action**: A strict evidentiary requirement dictating that no system action can compile or execute without a synchronous, immutable cryptographic audit trail.

## **Part I: Doctrinal and Strategic Research**

The theoretical and geopolitical foundations of Ternary Moral Logic are detailed in the following core reports. Each Markdown document is accompanied by an interactive HTML presentation for pedagogical and demonstrative purposes.

* **Doctrinal Research Manual For Dual Non-Negotiable Mandates**  
  * **Files**: .md, .html  
  * **Overview**: The central doctrinal hub defining the formal parameters of the mandates, the tri-state logic (Sacred Zero, Sacred Pause), and the strict archival rules for long term deployment.  
* **Universality Under Dual Non-Negotiable Mandates**  
  * **Files**: .md, .html, .mp3  
  * **Overview**: Explores the Goukassian Promise, triadic governance, and the philosophical bridge between abstract legal principles and operational facts. This section includes a comprehensive audio overview.  
* **Scalability of Ternary Moral Logic Under the No Spy No Weapon Mandate**  
  * **Files**: .md, .html  
  * **Overview**: Analyzes the inevitable global ecosystem split; evaluates interoperability and the practical realities of deploying the Sacred Zero at scale across civilian infrastructure.  
* **Technical, Economic, and Political Blueprint for Immutability in AI Governance**  
  * **Files**: .md, .html  
  * **Overview**: Provides a rigorous adversarial analysis; models economic sustainability in civilian markets against inevitable pushback from military and authoritarian state actors.

## **Part II: Architectural Implementation**

To prove these mandates are computable invariants rather than mere policy preferences, this folder contains four core execution files. Together they demonstrate the transition from philosophy to hard code:

* TML\_State\_Machine.sol: A Solidity smart contract representing the ultimate execution layer. It enforces the tri-state logic. Administrative privileges are permanently burned upon deployment to prevent authoritative overrides.  
* Semantic\_Proximity\_Trigger.py: The Python inference gatekeeper. It evaluates incoming payloads against prohibited domains to trigger the Sacred Zero when necessary.  
* NoS\_NoW\_Corpus.json: The strict configuration corpus containing the exact cryptographic hash signatures and semantic weights that define lethal targeting and mass surveillance.  
* Immutable\_Trace\_Logger.py: The cryptographic evidentiary backbone enforcing the rule that no action proceeds without an immutable ledger receipt.

## **Deployment Note**

The code provided in this repository serves as a structural prototype designed for archival doctrinal research. It mathematically proves that ethical constraints can be transformed from flexible corporate policy into rigid, inescapable computational architecture.  
If logging fails, execution halts. If the audit trail cannot be produced, the system cannot act. There are no exceptions.
