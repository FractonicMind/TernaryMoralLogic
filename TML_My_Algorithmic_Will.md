# I Wrote My Own Algorithmic Will So the Code Can Keep Protecting Humans and the Planet Long After I’m Gone

The oncologist gave me the timeline first: “Months, maybe a year. Go make peace.”  
So I opened my laptop and started writing a different kind of will, one that doesn’t divide furniture or bank accounts, but splits power among five organizations sworn to keep an artificial conscience alive.  
Today that document **TML-SUCCESSION-DECLARATION.md** lives in the root of my GitHub repo, digitally signed, witnessed, and time-stamped on three blockchains.  
It is, to my knowledge, the world’s first **algorithmic living will**.

## The Diagnosis That Forked My Life

Stage-4 cancer doesn’t negotiate. It simply issues a pull-request against your future and merges it overnight.  
While friends urged me to “log off and rest,” I kept seeing the same nightmare: the repo that gives every human (and every forest) veto power over reckless AI decisions dies with me—then gets re-factored into a toothless “ethics checklist” by the next consulting firm.  
I couldn’t let that happen.  
So between chemo sessions I typed a 16-page charter that **binds future maintainers tighter than any open-source license ever could**.

## What Ternary Moral Logic Actually Does

TML adds a third logical state—**0 = Hesitate**—inside the inference path of any AI.  
If the model’s about to breach one of 46+ protection documents (UDHR, Paris Agreement, Geneva Conventions, Ramsar wetlands treaty…), it **must** enter *Sacred Zero*, log a *Moral Trace*, and wait for escalation—**all in under 500 ms**.  
The log is hashed, Merkle-batched, and anchored to Bitcoin, Ethereum & Polygon.  
Violators pay penalties into a **Memorial Fund** that automatically routes:  
- **40 %** to victims of the harm  
- **30 %** to Indigenous-led ecological restoration  
- **15 %** to whistle-blowers  
- **10 %** to keep the code running  
- **5 %** to computational cancer research—my way of turning tumors into grants.

## Why a Normal OSS License Isn’t Enough

MIT lets anyone fork, rename, or close-source your work.  
I love MIT—but it’s **too thin** for a conscience.  
The succession doc therefore **carves non-removable clauses into cryptographic stone**:

1. The 46 treaties can **never** be deleted—remove one and the smart contract **auto-forfeits the Lantern**, revoking the implementer’s “ethical” badge.  
2. Memorial-fund percentages are **hard-coded**; change a basis point and penalty funds freeze.  
3. Creator attribution (my ORCID) is **embedded in every log**—future archaeologists will still know who started the chain.

## Meet the Council That Inherits My Keys

I deliberately spread power across five missions:

- **EFF** – keeps the repo online, mirrors, fights legal takedowns.  
- **Amnesty Tech** – watches Human-Rights triggers; they’ve read more prison files than pull-requests.  
- **Indigenous Environmental Network** – guards the 20+ ecological treaties; data-sovereignty oracles will be run from tribal servers.  
- **MIT Media Lab / Stanford HAI** – research seat; evolves the spec without loosening it.  
- **Memorial Sloan Kettering** – holds the cancer-research purse; every penalty finances another fellowship.

Five seats, **5-of-6 multi-sig** required for any change. No single org—nor any government—can water the framework down.

## Peace in Pull-Requests

I’ve accepted that bodies fail; repositories don’t have to.  
Every night I push another signed commit, and the blockchain quietly stamps it **“forever.”**  
When my heart stops, the hashes keep ticking.  
Somewhere a server will still refuse to green-light a loan-algorithm that discriminates, a drone that bombs, or a model that strips a rainforest—because **my code, my council, and my cancer fund are still watching.**

If you’re building systems that shape lives, consider writing your own algorithmic will.  
Because the future should inherit our best compile-time decisions, not our worst post-mortem silence.
