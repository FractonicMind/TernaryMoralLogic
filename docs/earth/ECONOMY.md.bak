# Stewardship Fund: Economic Architecture for Earth Protection

## Overview

The Stewardship Fund ensures permanent economic support for ecological monitoring and Indigenous data sovereignty. Funded by network operations, not charity. Communities protecting Earth receive direct compensation.

## Fund Structure

### Revenue Sources

```yaml
network_fees:
  transaction_base: 0.001%  # Every AI decision
  sacred_zero_events: 0.01%  # Higher for complex decisions
  allocation: 35%  # To Stewardship Fund

penalty_allocation:
  environmental_violations: 60%  # Majority to ecosystem restoration
  data_sovereignty_breaches: 50%  # Half to affected communities
  missing_logs: 40%  # Environmental oversight portion

commercial_licenses:
  enterprise_tml: 2%  # Of license fees
  carbon_intensive_industries: 5%  # Higher contribution
  
grants:
  foundation_endowment: "$10M initial"
  government_programs: "Various"
  impact_investments: "Outcomes-based"
```

### Distribution Formula

```python
def calculate_distribution():
    total_fund = get_monthly_balance()
    
    distribution = {
        "community_monitoring": 0.40,  # Direct to communities
        "oracle_operations": 0.20,     # DON node rewards
        "emergency_response": 0.15,    # Rapid ecological threats
        "infrastructure": 0.15,        # Offline bridges, tools
        "governance": 0.05,           # Council operations
        "reserve": 0.05              # Buffer for volatility
    }
    
    return allocate(total_fund, distribution)
```

## Community Compensation

### Monitoring Rewards

| Activity | Compensation | Frequency | Verification |
|----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Regular observation | $20-100 | Monthly | 3+ reports |
| Critical alert | $50-500 | Per event | Oracle validated |
| Seasonal assessment | $200-1000 | Quarterly | Community consensus |
| Emergency response | $500-5000 | Immediate | TML confirmed |
| Long-term study | $2000-10000 | Annual | Peer reviewed |

### Calculation Factors

```yaml
base_amount:
  factors:
    - ecological_severity  # Critical > High > Medium > Low
    - data_quality        # Completeness, evidence, witnesses
    - response_time       # Faster alerting = higher reward
    - historical_accuracy # Track record multiplier (0.8x - 2.0x)

adjustments:
  remote_location: 1.5x   # Harder to reach areas
  multiple_threats: 2.0x  # Compound ecological risks
  indigenous_knowledge: 1.3x  # Traditional indicators
  youth_participation: 1.2x   # Next generation engagement
```

### Payment Distribution

```json
{
  "payment_methods": {
    "digital": {
      "mobile_money": ["M-Pesa", "Orange Money", "bKash"],
      "crypto_stable": ["USDC", "DAI"],
      "bank_transfer": "Where available"
    },
    "physical": {
      "ngo_distribution": "Monthly cash delivery",
      "community_fund": "Collective accounts",
      "resource_credits": "Equipment, supplies"
    }
  },
  "timeline": {
    "critical_alerts": "24-48 hours",
    "regular_monitoring": "Monthly batch",
    "emergency_support": "Immediate"
  }
}
```

## Proof-of-Stewardship Tokens

### Design Principles

**Non-Financialized Reputation**:
- Cannot be traded or sold
- No monetary value
- Pure reputation metric
- Inherited by community, not individuals

### Token Accumulation

```python
def calculate_tokens(activity):
    base_tokens = {
        "verified_observation": 10,
        "critical_alert": 50,
        "false_positive": -20,  # Penalty for inaccuracy
        "community_validation": 5,
        "youth_training": 15
    }
    
    multipliers = {
        "consistency": 1.0 + (months_active * 0.1),  # Max 3x
        "accuracy": accuracy_rate ** 2,  # Quadratic reward
        "collaboration": 1.0 + (partner_communities * 0.2)
    }
    
    return base_tokens[activity] * calculate_multiplier(multipliers)
```

### Token Benefits

| Token Threshold | Benefit |
|----------------|---------|
| 100 | Sacred Zero council voting |
| 500 | Priority emergency support |
| 1000 | Regional coordinator eligibility |
| 5000 | TML assembly seat |
| 10000 | Permanent advisory position |

## Oracle Node Economics

### DON Compensation

```yaml
node_rewards:
  per_fetch: "$0.10"  # Successful data retrieval
  per_validation: "$0.05"  # Consensus participation
  uptime_bonus: "$50/month"  # 99.9% availability
  
slashing_conditions:
  false_data: -100 tokens
  downtime: -$10/hour
  collusion: permanent_ban
```

### Staking Requirements

```json
{
  "minimum_stake": {
    "full_node": "1000 TML tokens",
    "light_node": "100 TML tokens",
    "community_node": "10 TML tokens"
  },
  "returns": {
    "annual_yield": "8-12%",
    "performance_bonus": "Up to 5%",
    "slashing_risk": "Up to 50%"
  }
}
```

## Penalty Revenue

### Violation Fines

```yaml
environmental_penalties:
  minor_breach: "$10,000 - $100,000"
  major_violation: "$100,000 - $10M"
  systematic_harm: "$10M - $1B"
  
distribution:
  ecosystem_restoration: 40%
  affected_communities: 30%
  stewardship_fund: 20%
  legal_costs: 10%
```

### Corporate Contributions

Required contributions for high-impact sectors:

| Industry | Base Fee | Sacred Zero Rate | Annual Minimum |
|----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Fossil Fuels | 0.1% revenue | $100/event | $1M |
| Mining | 0.1% revenue | $75/event | $750K |
| Industrial Ag | 0.05% revenue | $50/event | $500K |
| Tech (high compute) | 0.02% revenue | $25/event | $250K |

## Risk Mitigation

### Economic Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |

| Fraud | Multi-signature validation, reputation system |
| Regulatory changes | Legal compliance fund, jurisdiction diversity |

**Economic Justice Principle**: Those who protect Earth should never bear the cost alone. The Stewardship Fund ensures that ecological guardianship is economically sustainable, not sacrificial.
