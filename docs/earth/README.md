# Earth Protection Framework

## Blockchain-Enforced Planetary Defense

TML's Earth Protection operates through **Blockchain automation**, not committees. Sacred Zero triggers for ecosystem threats are enforced by smart contracts, with penalties 3x higher than human harm. Implementation proceeds through validated mechanisms.

**Mathematical enforcement of 20+ environmental treaties.**

## Core Architecture

### üîó Blockchain Enforcement (MANDATORY)
```yaml
Smart Contract Penalties:
  ecosystem_harm: 3x multiplier
  indigenous_violations: 5x multiplier  
  future_generation_impact: 7x multiplier
  
Automatic Triggers:
  - Paris Agreement thresholds
  - IPCC carbon budgets
  - IUCN Red List species
  - Ramsar wetland protection
  - Indigenous FPIC protocols
```

### üìä Oracle Data Sources (AUTOMATIC)
```python
def enforce_earth_protection():
    """Treaties enforced without committees"""
    
    # Oracles fetch official data
    ipcc = oracle.fetch("ipcc.ch/api")
    cbd = oracle.fetch("cbd.int/api")
    unfccc = oracle.fetch("unfccc.int/api")
    
    # Smart contracts enforce automatically
    if violation_detected:
        penalty = base * 3  # Earth multiplier
        smart_contract.execute(penalty)
        Blockchain.compensate_ecosystem()
```

### üèõÔ∏è Stewardship Council (RECOMMENDED  ENHANCEMENT)
- **Not required** for deployment
- **Not required** for enforcement  
- **Not required** for penalties
- May be useful for complex scenarios
- Adds institutional attestation when available

## Key Documents

### ‚öñÔ∏è [LEGAL_MAPPING.md](./LEGAL_MAPPING.md)
How Blockchain oracles automatically ingest UN treaties, IPCC reports, and regional laws. No human curation needed.

### üåç [COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md](./COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md)
Direct Blockchain submission for Indigenous and local communities. No institutional gatekeeping. Automatic smart contract payments.

### üí∞ [ECONOMY.md](./ECONOMY.md)
Automated compensation via smart contracts. $20-5000 per observation paid instantly. No committee approval.

## Implementation Reality

### Functional Implementation
```bash
docker run tml/always-memory \
  --earth-protection=true \
  --blockchain=mandatory \
  --stewardship=false  # Not needed
  
# Fully operational
# 20+ treaties enforced
# No waiting for committees
```

### Sacred Zero Triggers (Automatic)

```yaml
Blockchain Enforced:
  Immediate_Refuse (-1):
    - Primary forest destruction
    - Sacred site damage
    - Critical habitat loss
    - FPIC violation
    
  Sacred_Zero (0):
    - Carbon budget exceeded
    - Water table depleted
    - Biodiversity threshold
    - Community objection
    
  All enforced by smart contracts
  No human approval needed
```

## Community Participation (Direct to Blockchain)

### Indigenous Data Sovereignty
```python
def submit_observation():
    """Communities submit directly to Blockchain"""
    
    observation = {
        'location': generalized_grid,  # Privacy preserved
        'impact': 'sacred_site_threat',
        'witnesses': 3,  # Minimum validation
        'evidence': ipfs_hash
    }
    
    # Submit to Blockchain
    tx = Blockchain.submit(observation)
    
    # Automatic payment
    smart_contract.pay_observers(amount)
    
    # No institution controls this data
    # Community maintains sovereignty
```

### Offline Methods Still Work
- SMS ‚Üí Blockchain bridge
- Satellite uplink ‚Üí Smart contract
- USB courier ‚Üí IPFS ‚Üí Chain
- All paths lead to immutable evidence

## Cost Analysis

### Blockchain-Only (Functional Requirement)
- Oracle subscriptions: $100/month
- Smart contract gas: $50/month
- IPFS storage: $50/month
- **Total: $200/month**
- Stewardship Council: $0

### With Recommended Stewardship (Enhancement)
- Everything above: $200/month
- Stewardship coordination: Variable cost
- Committee meetings: Time investment
- **Total: $200/month + coordination costs**
- Benefit: Additional verification layer

**Recommendation**: Implement Blockchain core, add stewardship when beneficial.

## Performance Guarantees

### Blockchain Speed
- Treaty update: <1 minute via oracles
- Violation detection: Real-time
- Penalty execution: Same block
- Ecosystem compensation: Automatic
- Evidence creation: Immutable

### Committee Speed (If Using Stewardship)
- Treaty review: Quarterly meetings
- Violation discussion: Weeks
- Penalty negotiation: Months
- Implementation timeline: Variable
- Evidence: Verifiable

## For Communities

**You have direct access:**
1. Submit observations to Blockchain (no gatekeepers)
2. Get paid automatically (smart contracts)
3. Maintain data sovereignty (you control keys)
4. Evidence is permanent (immutable)

**You DON'T need:**
- Stewardship approval for submissions
- Committee review for payments
- Institutional permission for access
- External consent for participation

## Security & Privacy

### Blockchain Native
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive locations
- Homomorphic encryption for data processing
- K-anonymity (k‚â•5) automatic
- GDPR compliant via crypto-shredding

### No Central Control
- No single entity controls data
- No committee can censor reports
- No institution can delete evidence
- Mathematics enforces protection

## Audit & Compliance

### Self-Auditing System
```solidity
contract EarthProtection {
    function auditCompliance() public view returns (bool) {
        // Check all violations logged
        require(allViolationsHaveProof(), "Missing logs");
        
        // Verify penalties paid
        require(allPenaltiesExecuted(), "Unpaid penalties");
        
        // Confirm ecosystem compensation
        require(compensationDistributed(), "Earth unpaid");
        
        return true;  // Mathematically verified
    }
}
```

## Philosophy

> "Earth cannot testify in court. Blockchain becomes its witness statement."

Every decision affecting the planet creates immutable evidence. Future generations will query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sacred_zero_logs 
WHERE chose_profit_over_planet = true
AND year BETWEEN 2025 AND 2050
```

The responsible parties, rejected alternatives, and moments of recognition‚Äîall permanently recorded on chains that outlive governments and corporations.

## Migration from Committee-Based

### If Transitioning to Blockchain
```bash
# Previous committee-based system
docker stop committee-based-tml

# Deploy Blockchain version
docker run tml/always-memory --earth-protection=true

# Earth protection active
# No committees needed
```

## Contributing

Earth Protection is **mandatory**, not optional. Contributions should:
- Strengthen smart contract enforcement
- Improve oracle reliability
- Enhance community access
- Support stewardship coordination when beneficial

## The Truth

**What protects Earth:**
- Blockchain immutability
- Smart contract automation
- Oracle treaty updates
- Mathematical consensus

**What enhances protection:**
- Committee coordination
- Institutional verification
- Stewardship attestations
- Human deliberation
