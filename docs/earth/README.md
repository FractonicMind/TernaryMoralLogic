# Earth Protection Framework

## Overview

TML's Earth Protection Framework treats planetary health as inseparable from human survival. Sacred Zero triggers equally for threats to ecosystems, water resources, biodiversity, or climate‚Äîbecause humanity cannot survive on a dead planet.

This directory contains the complete implementation for integrating ecological accountability into AI systems through Always Memory and the Guardian Network.

## Core Documents

### üìã [LEGAL_MAPPING.md](./LEGAL_MAPPING.md)
Dynamic integration of environmental laws and treaties. Defines how TML ingests UN agreements (Paris, CBD), scientific assessments (IPCC), and regional regulations as Sacred Zero triggers.

### üåç [COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md](./COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md)  
Enables Indigenous peoples and local communities to participate as sovereign ecological data stewards. Includes offline-first workflows (SMS, satellite, USB) and Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles.

### üí∞ [ECONOMY.md](./ECONOMY.md)
Stewardship Fund design ensuring sustainable compensation for ecological monitoring. Details payment structures ($20-5000 per observation)*, micro-grants, and Proof-of-Stewardship tokens.

*All amounts are nominal to 2025 USD

## Key Principles

### Two-Tier Data Architecture

**Tier 1: Global Baselines** (Mandatory)
- UN treaties and conventions
- Scientific consensus (IPCC, IUCN, Planetary Boundaries)
- Regional environmental regulations
- Cryptographically verified, daily updates

**Tier 2: Community Witness Layer**
- Indigenous and local observations
- Traditional ecological knowledge
- Minimum 3 witnesses for validation
- Sovereignty-respecting data control

### Sacred Zero Triggers

```yaml
Immediate Refuse (-1):
- Primary forest destruction
- Ramsar wetland damage
- Critical species habitat loss
- Sacred site disturbance

Sacred Zero (0):
- Carbon budget exceedance
- Groundwater depletion beyond recharge
- Biodiversity hotspot impact
- Community objection (FPIC violation)
- Conflicting ecological data
```

### Guardian Network Structure

11 Guardian Institutions:
- **4 Environmental Protection** (36%)
- 3 Academic Research (27%)
- 2 Technical Standards (18%)
- 2 Civil Society (18%)

Community representation: 3 effective seats through environmental and civil society categories.

## Implementation Components

### [Schemas](/schemas/earth/)
- `earth_extension.schema.json` - Extends Always Memory with ecological fields
- `community_registration.schema.json` - Community enrollment structure

### [Policies](/policies/earth/)
- `ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml` - Codified environmental triggers and thresholds

### [Governance](/governance/earth/)
- `COMMUNITY_SEAT_RULES.md` - Representation without accreditation
- `OMBUDSPERSON_PROTOCOL.md` - Dispute resolution maintaining Sacred Zero

### [Oracle Infrastructure](/oracles/)
- `oracle_bridge.py` - Fetches and validates ecological data
- `eco_oracle_network.json` - Decentralized oracle configuration

### [Testing](/tests/earth/)
- `baseline_cases.md` - Standard ecological scenarios
- `red_team/` - Attack surface and vulnerability testing

## Quick Start for Operators

1. **Review Legal Requirements**: Start with [LEGAL_MAPPING.md](./LEGAL_MAPPING.md) to understand mandatory data sources

2. **Set Up Oracle Bridge**: Configure [oracle_bridge.py](/oracles/oracle_bridge.py) to fetch Tier 1 data

3. **Enable Community Integration**: Follow [COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md](./COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md) for Tier 2 setup

4. **Configure Triggers**: Implement [ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml](/policies/earth/ECO_HARM_RULES.yaml)

5. **Test Implementation**: Run scenarios from [baseline_cases.md](/tests/earth/baseline_cases.md)

## For Communities

If you're an Indigenous or local community wanting to participate:

1. Read the [COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md](./COMMUNITY_GUIDE.md)
2. Choose your registration method (online/SMS/offline)
3. Understand the [ECONOMY.md](./ECONOMY.md) compensation structure
4. Know your sovereignty rights are absolute

## Security & Privacy

- **Community data**: K-anonymity (k‚â•5) for all reports
- **Location generalization**: Grid squares, not exact coordinates
- **Time randomization**: ¬±1 hour on reports
- **Crypto-shredding**: GDPR compliant while maintaining audit trail

## Conflict Resolution

When ecological data conflicts or stakeholders disagree:

1. Sacred Zero maintained during all disputes
2. Most protective interpretation prevails
3. Ombudsperson mediation available
4. 30-day maximum resolution timeline

See [OMBUDSPERSON_PROTOCOL.md](/governance/earth/OMBUDSPERSON_PROTOCOL.md) for details.

## Performance Requirements

- **Oracle consensus**: 5 of 9 nodes within 30 seconds
- **Community validation**: 3 witnesses minimum
- **Treaty updates**: Daily synchronization
- **Sacred Zero response**: <500ms for critical triggers

## Audit & Compliance

For auditors and compliance officers:

- All ecological decisions create immutable logs
- Treaty versions and hashes included in every decision
- Community reports cryptographically sealed
- Guardian attestations provide legal standing

## Green Score: 100/100

This framework received a perfect environmental readiness score for:
- Mandatory ecological protection in constitutional layer
- Indigenous peoples as data stewards, not subjects
- Future generations as explicit stakeholders
- Intergenerational justice in immutable logs

See [GEMINI_ASSESSMENT.md](./GEMINI_ASSESSMENT.md) for full evaluation.

## Philosophy

> "Earth cannot testify in court. Always Memory becomes its witness statement."

Every AI decision affecting the planet creates evidence that cannot be erased. Future generations will query: "Show me every algorithm that chose profit over preservation." The responsible parties, rejected alternatives, and moments of recognition‚Äîall permanently recorded.

This isn't greenwashing through marketing. It's cryptographically sealed accountability that power cannot delete.

## Contributing

Earth Protection is core to TML, not optional. Contributions should:
- Strengthen ecological triggers
- Improve community accessibility
- Enhance offline capabilities
- Reduce false positives without compromising protection
