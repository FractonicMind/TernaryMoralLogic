## Introduction

This guide helps Indigenous peoples, local communities, and environmental stewards integrate with TML's Earth Protection system. Your knowledge of local ecosystems is invaluable. This framework ensures your voice is heard and your sovereignty respected.

*"The forest knows what the servers don't. The river remembers what the algorithms forget. Through Always Memory, Earth's witnesses become Earth's protectors."*

Both missing files are now created. The Guardian implementation provides the technical infrastructure for distributed attestation, while the Community Guide empowers local and Indigenous communities to participate in Earth protection with full sovereignty and support.
