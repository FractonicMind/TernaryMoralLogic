## Core License Questions

### Q1: What license governs the TML Framework?
**MIT License** - one of the most permissive open-source licenses. Allows free use, modification, and distribution for commercial and non-commercial applications with minimal restrictions.

### Q2: Can I use TML in commercial AI systems?
**Yes, absolutely.** TML is designed for real-world AI accountability. You can integrate Sacred Zero logging into commercial products, consulting services, and enterprise systems without royalties or permission.

### Q3: What are my legal obligations under MIT License?
Only two requirements:
1. **Include copyright notice** and license text in distributions
2. **Acknowledge Lev Goukassian's authorship** when presenting TML concepts
3. **"AS IS" warranty disclaimer** - no liability from framework creators

### Q4: Can I create proprietary tools based on TML?
**Yes.** Build proprietary AI audit systems, investigation tools, and accountability platforms using TML. The MIT License permits derivative works you keep proprietary, but original TML core must retain attribution.

### Q5: Do I need permission for academic use?
**No permission needed.** TML is freely available for:
- AI ethics and accountability curricula
- Computer science and policy courses  
- Student research projects
- Academic research extending the framework

---

## Commercial Use

### Q6: Can consulting firms charge for TML implementation services?
**Yes.** Consulting firms can:
- Charge for TML integration services
- Develop proprietary audit methodologies
- Create commercial training programs
- Offer paid investigation services

The framework is free; you charge for expertise and services.

### Q7: Can I trademark products using TML?
**Yes, with limitations:** You can trademark your product names (e.g., "AccountabilityAI Proâ„¢ powered by TML"). Cannot trademark "TML," "Ternary Moral Logic," or "Sacred Zero" - these remain community terms.

### Q8: What about patents for TML-based innovations?
You may patent **specific novel implementations** or **technical improvements** you develop. However:
- Cannot patent core TML concepts or Sacred Zero mechanism
- Patents should focus on your unique technical contributions
- Consider ethical implications of restricting AI accountability innovations

### Q9: Can government agencies use TML?
**Yes, encouraged.** Government use permitted for:
- Public sector AI accountability
- Regulatory investigation systems  
- Democratic oversight infrastructure
- National AI transparency standards

No special license required.

### Q10: Are there geographic restrictions?
**No.** TML available worldwide without restrictions. Designed to support global AI accountability while respecting jurisdictional variations.

## Ethical Use and Framework Protection

### Q11: Can I modify TML requirements in my implementation?
**Legally yes, ethically discouraged.** MIT License allows modification, but reducing accountability contradicts TML's purpose. Such modifications:
- Undermine AI accountability objectives
- Create liability risks where transparency expected
- Violate democratic oversight intent
- Prevent investigation when AI causes harm

### Q12: What constitutes TML misuse?
Misuse includes:
- **Selective logging** while claiming universal TML compliance
- **"Ethics washing"** using TML branding without accountability
- **Circumventing audit trails** while maintaining compliance claims
- **Preventing investigation access** when incidents require evidence

While legally permitted, such uses violate framework foundations.

### Q13: Can I use TML to justify inadequate transparency?
**Absolutely not.** TML mandates comprehensive transparency through universal logging. Using it to rationalize limited disclosure is:
- Fundamental misunderstanding of the framework
- Potentially legally liable under enforcement mechanisms
- Violation of professional AI ethics standards

### Q14: What if someone misuses TML branding?
Community response includes:
- Public documentation of circumvention cases
- Community warnings about inadequate implementations
- Technical verification tools for authentic TML
- Collaboration with AI accountability organizations

Report violations to TML Governance Council.

### Q15: What defines authentic TML implementation?
Authentic implementation follows enforcement standards:
- Universal moral trace logging for AI interactions
- Sacred Zero triggered at organizational thresholds  
- Complete audit trail accessibility for investigation
- Council institution coordination for oversight

## Attribution and Research

### Q16: How should I cite TML in academic papers?
```
Goukassian, L. (2025). Ternary Moral Logic Framework: 
Enforcement Infrastructure for AI Accountability. 
Version 2.0.0. https://github.com/fractonicmind/TernaryMoralLogic
ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243
```

### Q17: Can I publish research extending TML without permission?
**Yes, encouraged.** Academic freedom is fundamental:
- Publish papers analyzing or extending TML
- Develop alternative accountability methodologies  
- Propose improvements to investigation protocols
- Conduct empirical validation studies

Proper attribution and constructive engagement appreciated.

### Q18: Can I use TML in competitive research grants?
**Fully permitted.** You can:
- Include TML in grant proposals
- Claim novel applications as your contribution
- Compete for funding with TML-based projects
- Lead multi-institutional research initiatives

### Q19: Can I create modified accountability frameworks?
**Yes.** MIT License allows creating modified versions for:
- Different regulatory requirements
- Domain-specific specifications
- Alternative investigation methodologies
- Experimental approaches

Use different name to avoid confusion with canonical TML.

### Q20: Must I share TML research data?
**Not required but encouraged.** Sharing advances accountability methodology:
- Investigation effectiveness validation
- Implementation challenge solutions
- Audit trail analysis improvements
- Collective learning benefits

### Q23: What if someone claims exclusive TML rights?
**They cannot.** Any such claims are fraudulent:
- Permanently public via MIT License
- Protected by council governance
- Defended by academic community
- Documented in audit records

### Q24: Can I create commercial TML certification?
**Yes, with transparency:** You can offer paid certification but:
- Cannot claim "official" or "only" authority
