# TML Framework - License FAQ v3.0

**Creator**: Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  
**Version**: 3.0 (Blockchain-Enforced)  
**Architecture**: MIT License + Smart Contract Enforcement

---

## Core License Reality

### Q1: What license governs TML?
**MIT License** - completely permissive. But violations trigger **Blockchain penalties** automatically. The license is free; the accountability is mathematical.

### Q2: Can I use TML commercially?
**Yes.** But missing Always Memory logs = criminal prosecution. The license permits everything; the Blockchain enforces everything.

### Q3: What are my real obligations?
**Legal (MIT)**: Just attribution  
**Blockchain**: 100% logging or face penalties  
**Criminal**: Missing logs = strict liability

### Q4: Who enforces TML compliance?
**Smart contracts**, not committees. Blockchain detects violations and executes penalties automatically. 

---

## Commercial Reality Check

### Q5: Can I modify TML to avoid Sacred Zero?
**Legally**: MIT allows it  
**Practically**: Blockchain will detect and penalize  
**Criminally**: Prosecutors will use it as evidence of intent  
**Cost**: $500M minimum penalty + prosecution

### Q6: Can I claim "TML Certified" falsely?
```solidity
contract FakeCertificationDetection {
    function detectFalseClaims(address company) public {
        if (!hasValidBlockchainLogs(company)) {
            penalty = $100_000_000;  // Fraud
            prosecute(company);
            emit FalseTMLClaim(company);
        }
    }
}
```

### Q7: What about "ethics washing" with TML?
**Blockchain makes it impossible.** Either you have immutable logs on-chain or you don't. No committee to fool, just mathematical proof.

---

## Framework Protection

### Q8: Can someone capture TML?
**No.** Blockchain is distributed globally. Would cost $50B to attack. MIT License is irrevocable. Stewardship committees (when established) verify but don't control.

### Q9: What if someone trademarked "TML"?
**Irrelevant.** Blockchain doesn't care about trademarks. Smart contracts execute based on cryptographic proof, not brand names.

### Q10: Will TML become paid?
**Never.** MIT License is permanent. Blockchain is public. Smart contracts are immutable. Even if someone tried, the Blockchain continues regardless.

---

## Misuse and Penalties

### Q11: What constitutes misuse?
```python
misuse_detection = {
    "selective_logging": "$500M penalty",
    "missing_logs": "Criminal prosecution",
    "fake_compliance": "$1B + fraud charges",
    "circumvention": "10x penalties",
    
    "enforcement": "Automatic via Blockchain",
    "committee_review": "Optional verification"
}
```

### Q12: Who investigates violations?
**Whistleblowers** report to Blockchain → **Smart contracts** verify → **Penalties** execute → **Prosecutors** follow Blockchain evidence

Stewardship committees may provide additional verification.

### Q13: Can I get permission to skip logging?
**From who?** There's no committee granting exceptions. Blockchain doesn't grant exceptions. Math doesn't negotiate.

---

## Attribution Requirements

### Q14: How do I cite TML?
```bibtex
@software{goukassian2025tml,
  title={TML: Blockchain-Enforced AI Accountability},
  author={Goukassian, Lev},
  year={2025},
  note={Smart contracts and stewardship verification},
  orcid={0009-0006-5966-1243}
}
```

### Q15: Must I mention Blockchain enforcement?
**Yes.** Claiming TML without Blockchain anchoring = fraud. The accountability isn't optional.

---

## Stewardship Council Questions

### Q16: How do I contact the TML Council?
**Current status:** Blockchain-based verification is primary. Future stewardship councils will enhance but not replace this:
- Report violations: Direct to smart contracts
- Get rewards: Automatic 15% bounty
- Verify compliance: Check Blockchain explorers

### Q17: Do stewards approve implementations?
**No.** Blockchain validates automatically. Stewardship verification (when available) provides additional assurance.

### Q18: Can stewards override Blockchain?
```solidity
function stewardshipOverride() public pure {
    revert("Mathematics doesn't negotiate");
}
```

---

## Future Development

### Q19: Will future versions break compatibility?
**Impossible.** Blockchain is immutable. Smart contracts can't be changed. Stewardship councils verify existing implementations.

### Q20: Can I contribute to TML?
**Yes**, via:
- GitHub pull requests (code)
- Blockchain deployments (infrastructure)
- Violation reporting (15% rewards)
- Future stewardship participation (when established)

---

## Regulatory Compliance

### Q21: Does TML meet EU AI Act requirements?
**Exceeds them.** Blockchain evidence is court-admissible. Smart contract penalties are automatic. No committee delays justice.

### Q22: What about GDPR?
**Fully compatible.** Only hashes on-chain (no personal data). Crypto-shredding for erasure. Audit trail preserved.

---

## The Reality Check

### Q23: Is TML really decentralized?
```python
decentralization_proof = {
    "smart_contracts": "Immutable on multiple chains",
    "enforcement": "Automatic, no human control",
    "penalties": "Mathematical calculation",
    "evidence": "Distributed across all nodes",
    "stewardship": "Optional verification layer",
    "actual_control": "Nobody - math rules"
}
```

### Q24: What's the catch?
**There isn't one.** MIT License = free use. Blockchain = unstoppable enforcement. Violations = automatic penalties. Stewardship = additional verification when available.

### Q25: Why mention stewardship councils?
Because organizations benefit from institutional verification that:
- Enhances credibility
- Provides governance structure
- Adds human wisdom to mathematical enforcement
- Creates accountability community
