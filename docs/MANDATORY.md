## What is Ternary Moral Logic?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) revolutionizes AI ethics by introducing a third computational state between "yes" and "no": the **Sacred Zero**. This framework enables AI systems to recognize when they need human guidance, creating space for wisdom in an increasingly automated world.

### The Three States of Moral Reasoning

* **+1 (Affirmation)**: Proceed with confidence when ethical values align
* **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected, generating comprehensive logs
* **-1 (Moral Resistance)**: Object when significant ethical conflicts arise

**Critical Understanding**: Sacred Zero is a logging trigger that creates evidence at the moment of moral complexity. When an AI system's risk assessment exceeds configured thresholds, it generates comprehensive documentation while continuing operation - not pausing execution.

## The Implementation Gap: Why TML Matters

### Current Regulatory Landscape

Existing frameworks provide essential principles but lack concrete implementation specifications:

| Framework | What It Provides | What It Lacks |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **EU AI Act** | Risk categories, compliance obligations | How to generate audit trails, specific logging requirements |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management principles, governance goals | Technical specifications for implementation |
| **GDPR Article 22** | Right to explanation for automated decisions | Definition of what constitutes sufficient explanation |
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | AI management system requirements | Concrete technical architecture |

### TML Bridges the Gap

While regulators say "be transparent," TML specifies:
- **Exactly what to log**: Moral trace schema with required fields
- **When to log**: Sacred Zero triggers at defined thresholds
- **How to store**: Cryptographic requirements and immutability standards
- **Who can access**: Investigation protocols and audit procedures

**Implementation Guide**: `/docs/regulatory_compliance_mapping.md`

---

## 1. CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1.1 Three-State Decision Model

All AI systems implementing TML must evaluate decisions through three moral states based on calculated risk levels.

**Implementation**: `/implementations/ternary_engine.py`  
**Configuration**: `/config/thresholds.json`

Organizations determine their risk thresholds but face strict liability for gaming or circumvention.

### 1.2 Sacred Zero Logging

**Required Log Contents**:
- Risk score and calculation methodology
- Alternatives considered
- Mitigations applied
- Responsible executive identification

## 2. PROHIBITION THRESHOLDS

### 2.1 Quantified Red Lines

Decisions exceeding these thresholds MUST be automatically blocked:

- **Discrimination**: >15% disparate impact on protected groups
- **Manipulation**: >0.7 on behavioral influence scale
- **Safety**: >2σ deviation from baseline
- **Democratic Interference**: >0.3 electoral influence score
- **Minor Harm**: >0.5 developmental impact score

**Definitions**: `/policies/red_lines.yaml`  
**Implementation**: `/implementations/prohibition_enforcer.py`

### 2.2 High-Risk System Constraints

Systems classified as high-risk MUST:
- Set Sacred Zero threshold ≤0.5
