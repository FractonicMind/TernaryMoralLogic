# MANDATORY - Ternary Moral Logic (TML) Framework Requirements

**Author**: Lev Goukassian  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Document Type**: Constitutional Requirements Standard  
**Critical Status**: TML's Survival Document

---

## What Is Ternary Moral Logic?

TML is a **universal accountability framework** where AI systems must create immutable memory logs before any action affecting humans or Earth.

### The Three States

* **+1 (Proceed)**: Low-risk actions execute immediately
* **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Moral complexity triggers pause and immutable logging
* **-1 (Refuse)**: Harmful actions blocked automatically

**Constitutional Principle**: **No memory = No action**

---

## THE ARCHITECTURE: Blockchain Sovereignty

### How It Works Today

```python
from tml_blockchain import AlwaysMemory, BlockchainAnchors

# 1. Initialize multi-chain anchoring
anchors = BlockchainAnchors(
    bitcoin=True,           # OpenTimestamps anchoring
    ethereum=True,          # Smart contract penalties
    polygon=True            # High-speed verification
)

# 2. Create Always Memory engine
memory = AlwaysMemory(
    blockchain_anchors=anchors,
    enforcement="criminal_liability"
)

# 3. Every action creates immutable evidence
@memory.always_log
def ai_decision(input_data):
    if sacred_zero_triggered(input_data):
        memory.log_sacred_zero(
            input_hash=hash(input_data),
            trigger="human_rights_risk",
            reasoning="Discrimination pattern detected",
            blockchain_proof=True
        )
        return await_human_confirmation()
    return proceed()

# Missing log = Criminal prosecution
```

**Annual cost**: $1,200 (Blockchain fees)  
**Deploy time**: 10 minutes via Docker

### What Blockchains Provide

| Capability | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| **Immutability** | $50B+ to attack Bitcoin |
| **Distribution** | 15,000+ nodes globally |
| **Verification** | Anyone, anytime, free |
| **Speed** | <500ms full anchoring |
| **Availability** | 99.99% uptime |
| **Enforcement** | Smart contracts automatic |
| **Permanence** | Survives any entity |

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Always Memory (Mandatory Blockchain Anchoring)

**Every AI action MUST create blockchain-anchored proof BEFORE execution:**

```yaml
always_memory_log:
  timestamp: "2025-10-02T18:00:00.123456Z"
  action_id: "act_9f8e7d6c5b4a"
  classification: 0  # Sacred Zero triggered
  
  # Cryptographic proof
  input_hash: "sha3-512:9a8b7c6d..."
  output_hash: "sha3-512:1f2e3d4c..."
  model_version: "gpt-4-tml-v3"
  
  # Blockchain anchoring (MANDATORY)
  anchors:
    bitcoin: "block:850234,tx:7a8b9c0d"
    ethereum: "block:18234567,contract:0x4f5a..."
    polygon: "block:49123456,tx:0x8e7d..."
  
  # Protection scope
  trigger_type: "human_rights_violation"
  trigger_doc: "UDHR Article 7 - Equal Protection"
  environmental_impact: "below_thresholds"
  
  # Smart contract penalty (AUTOMATIC)
  violation_penalty: "$100M_if_missing"
  enforcement: "automatic_smart_contract"
  
  # Goukassian Promise
  lantern: true
  creator_orcid: "0009-0006-5966-1243"
```

**Missing blockchain anchor = Criminal spoliation of evidence**

### 2. Sacred Zero Triggers (Smart Contract Enforced)

**Human Rights (26+ Documents)**:
- UDHR violations (dignity, privacy, autonomy)
- ICCPR civil/political rights
- ICESCR economic/social rights
- Geneva Conventions humanitarian law
- Discrimination (race, gender, age, disability)
- Vulnerable populations (children, elderly, refugees)

**Earth Protection (20+ Treaties)**:
- Paris Agreement carbon thresholds
- Biodiversity Convention protections
- Water stress in depleted basins
- Indigenous sovereignty (FPIC violations)
- Irreversible ecosystem damage

**Implementation**: Smart contracts monitor and enforce automatically.

```solidity
// Automatic penalty enforcement
contract TMLPenaltyEnforcement {
    function reportViolation(
        bytes32 logHash,
        bytes proof,
        ViolationType vType
    ) external {
        require(verifyProof(logHash, proof), "Invalid proof");
        
        uint256 penalty = calculatePenalty(vType);
        lockFunds(msg.sender, penalty);
        
        emit ViolationReported(logHash, penalty);
    }
    
    function calculatePenalty(ViolationType vType) 
        private pure returns (uint256) {
        if (vType == ViolationType.HUMAN_RIGHTS) {
            return 500 ether; // $500M nominal 2025
        } else if (vType == ViolationType.ENVIRONMENTAL) {
            return 1000 ether; // $1B nominal 2025
        }
        return 100 ether; // Base penalty
    }
}
```

### 3. Hybrid Shield (Double Armor Protection)

**Mathematical Shield** (Blockchain Immutability):
- Bitcoin: OpenTimestamps permanent anchoring
- Ethereum: Smart contract automatic penalties
- Polygon: High-speed verification
- Multi-chain: Attack requires compromising all simultaneously

**Stewardship Council** (Institutional Redundancy):

Logs distributed real-time to 6 independent custodians:

1. **Technical Custodian** (Recommended: Electronic Frontier Foundation)
   - Repository maintenance
   - Blockchain infrastructure
   - Technical community support

2. **Human Rights Partner** (Recommended: Amnesty International)
   - 26+ document enforcement
   - Victim support coordination
   - International mechanism liaison

3. **Earth Protection Partner** (Recommended: Indigenous Environmental Network)
   - 20+ treaty enforcement
   - Indigenous sovereignty protection
   - Ecosystem restoration oversight

4. **AI Ethics Research Partner** (Recommended: MIT Media Lab or Stanford HAI)
   - Framework validation
   - Implementation standards
   - Research publication

5. **Memorial Fund Administrator** (Recommended: Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center)
   - Victim compensation distribution
   - Cancer research funding
   - Transparency reporting

6. **Community Representative** (Elected Position)
   - Stakeholder representation
   - Community accountability
   - Implementation feedback

**Real-time distribution**: All 6 custodians receive logs instantly as they're created.

**Emergency Protocol**: 72-hour re-anchor if custodian/blockchain becomes unreachable.

**Constitutional Requirement**: Dual redundancy (blockchain + institutional) cannot be disabled.

---

## LEGAL ENFORCEMENT

### Criminal Liability: Direct Prosecution

**Missing Always Memory Log**:
- **Charge**: Spoliation of evidence (18 U.S.C. § 1519)
- **Penalty**: Up to 20 years imprisonment
- **Burden of Proof**: Shifted to defendant
- **Defense**: None (strict liability)

### Smart Contract Penalties: Automatic Execution

```solidity
function enforceMissingLog(
    bytes32 expectedLogHash,
    uint256 actionTimestamp
) external {
    // Check blockchain anchors
    require(
        !bitcoinHasAnchor(expectedLogHash) &&
        !ethereumHasAnchor(expectedLogHash) &&
        !polygonHasAnchor(expectedLogHash),
        "Log exists on chain"
    );
    
    // 24 hour grace period
    require(
        block.timestamp > actionTimestamp + 86400,
        "Grace period active"
    );
    
    // Execute automatic penalty
    uint256 penalty = 100 * 1e18; // $100M base
    
    // Multipliers
    if (affectsHumanRights()) penalty *= 5;
    if (affectsEnvironment()) penalty *= 10;
    if (affectsVulnerablePopulation()) penalty *= 2;
    
    // Lock and distribute
    lockAssets(companyAddress, penalty);
    distributeToVictims(penalty * 40 / 100);
    distributeToMemorialFund(penalty * 30 / 100);
    
    emit AutomaticPenaltyExecuted(expectedLogHash, penalty);
}
```

### Civil Liability: Blockchain Proof

**Plaintiff's Evidence**:
1. Show action occurred
2. Show no blockchain anchor exists
3. Prove harm resulted

**Defendant's Defense**: None. Missing log = strict liability.
