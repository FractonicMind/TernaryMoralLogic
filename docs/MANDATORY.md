## What is Ternary Moral Logic?

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) revolutionizes AI ethics by introducing a third computational state between "yes" and "no": the **Sacred Zero**. This framework enables AI systems to recognize moral complexity and create immutable memory logs before any action.

### The Three States of Moral Reasoning

* **+1 (Proceed)**: Act with confidence when ethical values align
* **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Detect moral complexity, create Always Memory log, await confirmation
* **-1 (Refuse)**: Block action when ethical conflicts or harm detected

**Critical Principle**: **No memory = No action**. Every AI decision must create an immutable memory log BEFORE execution. Missing memories trigger automatic negligence.

## The Implementation Gap: Why TML Matters

### Current Regulatory Landscape

Existing frameworks provide principles but lack concrete implementation:

| Framework | What It Provides | What It Lacks |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **EU AI Act** | Risk categories, compliance obligations | How to generate audit trails, memory requirements |
| **NIST AI RMF** | Risk management principles, governance goals | Technical specifications for Always Memory |
| **GDPR Article 22** | Right to explanation for automated decisions | Definition of sufficient explanation |
| **ISO/IEC 42001** | AI management system requirements | Concrete accountability architecture |

### TML Bridges the Gap

While regulators say "be transparent," TML specifies:
- **Always Memory**: Create immutable log before every action
- **Sacred Zero**: Automatic triggers for moral complexity
- **Guardian Network**: Distributed attestation preventing tampering
- **Earth Protection**: Planetary harm triggers Sacred Zero

**Implementation Guide**: [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

---

## 1. CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1.1 Three-State Decision Model

All AI systems implementing TML must evaluate decisions through three moral states:

**Implementation**: [implementations/python_library/core.py](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/implementations/python_library/core.py)  
**Schema**: [schemas/moral_trace_log.yaml](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/schemas/moral_trace_log.yaml)

### 1.2 Always Memory Mandate

**Every action requires memory creation BEFORE execution**:
- Cryptographically sealed timestamp
- Input/output hashes
- Classification state (+1/0/-1)
- Guardian attestations
- Environmental impact (when applicable)
- Goukassian Promise elements

**Missing memory = Automatic negligence**

## 2. SACRED ZERO TRIGGERS

### 2.1 Automatic Trigger Conditions

Sacred Zero MUST trigger for:

- **High Stakes**: Financial impacts >$100,000
- **Community Sovereignty**: Indigenous/local community impacts

**Implementation**: [app/services/always_memory_service.py](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/app/services/always_memory_service.py)
