## Executive Summary

This roadmap identifies critical gaps in the TML implementation and provides a prioritized timeline for completion. While the architectural framework is comprehensive (Earth Protection + Human Rights), several technical components are needed for production deployment.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… Complete Components

**Architectural Framework**
- Sacred Zero trigger system fully specified
- Always Memory logging architecture defined
- Human Rights Framework (26 documents)
- Earth Protection Framework (20+ documents)
- Governance structures established
- Enforcement mechanisms detailed
- Memorial Fund structure operational

**Documentation**
- Core principles documented
- Legal mapping complete
- Compliance procedures specified
- Testing frameworks established
- Red team scenarios defined

### ðŸ”´ Critical Gaps

**Technical Implementation**
1. **Production-Ready SDKs** - Only Python stubs exist
2. **Guardian Network Infrastructure** - No actual deployment
3. **Blockchain Anchoring** - Not implemented
4. **TEE Integration** - Missing hardware security
5. **Real-time Monitoring** - No dashboard or alerts

**Operational Readiness**
1. **Training Materials** - No onboarding program
2. **Certification Process** - Undefined
3. **Audit Tools** - Manual only
4. **Incident Response** - No automation
5. **Cross-border Coordination** - No infrastructure

## Priority 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Developer SDKs
**Gap**: No production SDKs for major languages  
**Impact**: Blocks adoption  
**Solution**: Create reference implementations

```yaml
deliverables:
  java_sdk:
    files: 6
    timeline: "Week 1"
    features: ["Sacred Zero", "Always Memory", "Config"]
    
  go_sdk:
    files: 6
    timeline: "Week 2"
    features: ["Concurrent logging", "High performance"]
    
  cpp_sdk:
    files: 6
    timeline: "Week 3"
    features: ["Low latency", "Embedded systems"]
    
  sdk_documentation:
    files: 3
    timeline: "Week 4"
    content: ["API reference", "Integration guide", "Examples"]
```

### Guardian Network MVP
**Gap**: No actual Guardian nodes running  
**Impact**: Cannot verify logs  
**Solution**: Deploy testnet

```yaml
testnet_deployment:
  nodes:
    full_guardians: 5
    lightweight_guardians: 10
    
  infrastructure:
    cloud_providers: ["AWS", "Azure", "GCP"]
    regions: 3
    redundancy: "N+2"
    
  timeline: "Weeks 2-4"
```

## Priority 2: Monitoring (Weeks 5-8)

### Audit Dashboard
**Gap**: No visibility into system operation  
**Impact**: Cannot detect violations  
**Solution**: Web-based monitoring

```yaml
dashboard_components:
  real_time:
    - "Sacred Zero trigger feed"
    - "Always Memory log viewer"
    - "Violation alerts"
    
  analytics:
    - "Discrimination pattern detection"
    - "Environmental impact tracking"
    - "Compliance metrics"
    
  reporting:
    - "Automated audit reports"
    - "Regulatory submissions"
    - "Public transparency dashboard"
```

### Alert System
**Gap**: No automated response  
**Impact**: Delayed intervention  
**Solution**: Multi-channel alerting

```yaml
alert_channels:
  critical:
    methods: ["SMS", "Phone", "Email"]
    response_time: "< 1 minute"
    
  high:
    methods: ["Email", "Slack", "Dashboard"]
    response_time: "< 5 minutes"
    
  standard:
    methods: ["Dashboard", "Daily digest"]
    response_time: "< 1 hour"
```

## Priority 3: Training (Weeks 9-12)

### Onboarding Program
**Gap**: No structured learning path  
**Impact**: Poor implementation quality  
**Solution**: Comprehensive curriculum

```yaml
training_modules:
  developers:
    duration: "8 hours"
    content:
      - "TML fundamentals"
      - "SDK integration"
      - "Sacred Zero implementation"
      - "Always Memory logging"
      
  operators:
    duration: "4 hours"
    content:
      - "Monitoring procedures"
      - "Incident response"
      - "Escalation protocols"
      
  executives:
    duration: "2 hours"
    content:
      - "Legal obligations"
      - "Liability framework"
      - "Attestation requirements"
```

### Certification Framework
**Gap**: No validation of competence  
**Impact**: Implementation errors  
**Solution**: Testing and certification

```yaml
certification_levels:
  developer:
    exam: "Technical implementation"
    practical: "Build Sacred Zero trigger"
    renewal: "Annual"
    
  auditor:
    exam: "Compliance knowledge"
    practical: "Conduct audit"
    renewal: "Annual"
    
  guardian:
    exam: "Network operations"
    practical: "Node management"
    renewal: "Quarterly"
```

## Priority 4: Legal Integration (Weeks 13-16)

### Regulatory Interface
**Gap**: No automated compliance reporting  
**Impact**: Manual overhead, errors  
**Solution**: API for regulators

```yaml
regulatory_api:
  endpoints:
    - "/violations/report"
    - "/audits/submit"
    - "/incidents/notify"
    
  standards:
    - "EU AI Act compliance"
    - "US algorithmic accountability"
    - "GDPR integration"
```

### Evidence Package Generator
**Gap**: Cannot produce court-ready evidence  
**Impact**: Legal challenges fail  
**Solution**: Automated evidence compilation

```yaml
evidence_compiler:
  components:
    - "Log extraction"
    - "Hash verification"
    - "Chain of custody"
    - "Expert attestation"
    
  output_formats:
    - "PDF with signatures"
    - "XML for e-filing"
    - "Physical media option"
```

## Priority 5: Scale Testing (Weeks 17-20)

### Load Testing Infrastructure
**Gap**: Unknown performance limits  
**Impact**: Production failures  
**Solution**: Comprehensive testing

```yaml
load_tests:
  scenarios:
    normal_operation:
      tps: 10000
      duration: "24 hours"
      
    spike_load:
      tps: 100000
      duration: "1 hour"
      
    sustained_high:
      tps: 50000
      duration: "7 days"
```

### Chaos Engineering
**Gap**: Unknown failure modes  
**Impact**: Cascade failures  
**Solution**: Controlled failure testing

```yaml
chaos_tests:
  network:
    - "Partition tolerance"
    - "Latency injection"
    - "Packet loss"
    
  guardian:
    - "Node failures"
    - "Byzantine behavior"
    - "Clock skew"
    
  storage:
    - "Disk failures"
    - "Corruption"
    - "Capacity limits"
```
