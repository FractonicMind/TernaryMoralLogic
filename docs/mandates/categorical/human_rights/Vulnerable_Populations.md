# Vulnerable Populations: Enhanced Protection Framework

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/categorical/human_rights/Vulnerable_Populations.md`  
**Category**: Categorical (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

This document establishes enhanced Sacred Zero protections for populations facing heightened vulnerability due to age, disability, displacement, discrimination, or systemic marginalization. Every AI system must recognize that vulnerability compounds harm—what might be inconvenience for some is catastrophe for others.

## Executive Summary

Vulnerability is not inherent weakness but societal failure to accommodate human diversity. This framework operationalizes special protections mandated by international law, ensuring AI systems identify vulnerable contexts, apply enhanced safeguards, and never exploit power imbalances.

## Core Principles

```yaml
vulnerability_framework:
  intersectionality:
    principle: "Vulnerabilities compound"
    example: "Disabled refugee child = triple protection"
    implementation: "Cumulative safeguards"
    
  context_dependent:
    principle: "Vulnerability is situational"
    example: "CEO vulnerable as hospital patient"
    assessment: "Dynamic not static"
    
  agency_preserving:
    principle: "Protection not paternalism"
    approach: "Support autonomy"
    never: "Substitute decision-making"
    
  dignity_based:
    principle: "Vulnerability ≠ less human"
    recognition: "Equal worth, extra protection"
    algorithmic_pity: "refuse"
```
