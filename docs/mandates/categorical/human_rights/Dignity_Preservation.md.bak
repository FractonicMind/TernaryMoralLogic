# Dignity Preservation: The Inviolable Core of Human Worth

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/categorical/human_rights/Dignity_Preservation.md`  
**Category**: Categorical (Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

Human dignity is the foundational principle from which all rights flow. This document operationalizes dignity preservation in AI systems, ensuring every algorithm recognizes the inherent worth of every person, regardless of circumstance. Dignity is not earned, granted, or removableâ€”it simply is.

## Executive Summary

Dignity is both the simplest and most complex concept in human rights. Simple because every human possesses it equally. Complex because its violations take infinite forms. This framework ensures AI systems preserve dignity through recognition, respect, and protection of human worth in all its manifestations.

> "Liberty is measured by the freedom of the most stigmatised person in the farthest cell." - Lev Goukassian

**Remember**: Dignity is the irreducible core of what makes us human. Every algorithm that touches a human life either affirms or undermines dignity. There is no neutral code when human worth is at stake. Build systems that see the infinite in every person, especially those society has forgotten.
