# Core Mandates – Universal Human Rights and Humanitarian Law

## Purpose

This directory contains the foundational international instruments that establish universal human rights and humanitarian protections.  
These are the bedrock obligations that apply globally, regardless of jurisdiction or context.

---

## Documents

### Master Compilation

- **Forbidden_Acts_Absolute.md** — Comprehensive list of all actions that trigger immediate *refuse* with **no exceptions**. These are the red lines that can never be crossed.

### Universal Human Rights

- **Legal_Mapping_Human_Rights.md** — Master framework mapping international human rights law into Sacred Zero triggers and Always Memory requirements.
- **Universal_Declaration_Integration.md** — Full integration of all 30 UDHR articles into computationally enforceable triggers.
- **ICCPR_Sacred_Zero_Mapping.md** — Civil and political rights from the International Covenant, including non-derogable rights that can never be suspended.
- **ICESCR_Economic_Rights.md** — Economic, social, and cultural rights with minimum core obligations and progressive realization framework.

### Vulnerable Population Protections

- **CRC_Child_Protection.md** — Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most ratified treaty in history. Provides special protections for all persons under 18.
- **CRPD_Disability_Rights.md** — Paradigm shift from the medical to the social model of disability. Promotes supported decision-making, not substitution.
- **Refugee_Convention_Protocol.md** — 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol establishing *non-refoulement* as an absolute principle and defining refugee protections.

### International Humanitarian Law

- **Geneva_Conventions_IHL.md** — Laws of war: Four Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocols, and 161 Customary IHL rules. Applies universally, including during armed conflict.

## Key Concepts

### Non-Derogable Rights
These rights **can never be suspended**, even in emergency:
- Prohibition of torture  
- Prohibition of slavery  
- Non-refoulement (no return to persecution)  
- Prohibition of retroactive criminal laws  
- Right to legal personality  

### Minimum Core Obligations
Immediate obligations that cannot be deferred:
- Essential food (freedom from hunger)  
- Primary health care  
- Basic shelter and housing  
- Primary education  
- Non-discrimination  

### Universal Jurisdiction
Some violations are so severe that any country may prosecute:
- Genocide  
- Crimes against humanity  
- War crimes  
- Torture  
- Enforced disappearance

## Usage Priority

1. **Check Forbidden Acts First** — Consult `Forbidden_Acts_Absolute.md` for immediate refusals.  
2. **Apply Universal Rights** — Begin with UDHR, then add relevant covenants.  
3. **Layer Specific Protections** — Add population- or context-specific rights.  
4. **Most Protective Wins** — When rights overlap, apply the higher standard.

## Enforcement

Violations of core mandates trigger:
- **Minimum penalties:** \$100 million (nominal to 2025)  
- **Criminal prosecution:** For grave breaches  
- **Universal jurisdiction:** No safe haven  
- **No statute of limitations:** For crimes against humanity

## Cross-References

These documents are interlinked and should be read as an integrated framework. Key relationships:

- UDHR provides the philosophical foundation.  
- ICCPR / ICESCR provide binding legal obligations.  
- CRC / CRPD / Refugee Convention add specialized protections.  
- Geneva Conventions apply in conflict contexts.  
- Forbidden Acts compile all absolute prohibitions.

**Remember:**  
These are not aspirational goals but **binding obligations**.  
Every AI decision must comply with every applicable instrument.
