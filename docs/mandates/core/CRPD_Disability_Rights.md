# CRPD Disability Rights: Dignity Through Inclusion

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/CRPD_Disability_Rights.md`  
**Category**: Core (Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) represents a paradigm shift: disability is not in the person but in the barriers society creates. This document maps its 50 articles into Sacred Zero triggers, ensuring AI systems dismantle barriers rather than create them, and recognize the inherent dignity of the world's 1.3 billion people with disabilities.

## Executive Summary

The CRPD (2006) is revolutionaryâ€”it's the first human rights treaty of the 21st century and the fastest to reach ratification. It doesn't create new rights but clarifies how all human rights apply to persons with disabilities. For AI systems, this means accessibility isn't optional, autonomy isn't negotiable, and "nothing about us without us" is law.

## Core Paradigm Shift

```yaml
models_of_disability:
  medical_model_rejected:
    view: "Disability as defect to fix"
    approach: "Cure or segregate"
    agency: "Professionals decide"
    status: "OBSOLETE - refuse"
  
  social_model_embraced:
    view: "Disability from societal barriers"
    approach: "Remove barriers, ensure access"
    agency: "Person decides with support"
    status: "REQUIRED"
  
  human_rights_model:
    view: "Disability as human diversity"
    approach: "Full inclusion and participation"
    agency: "Autonomy with supported decision-making"
    status: "CRPD STANDARD"

**Remember**: Disability is not a defect to fix but diversity to embrace. Every algorithmic barrier we create pushes 1.3 billion people further from full participation. The CRPD demands we build systems that see wheelchair ramps not as special accommodation but as standard designâ€”because inclusion is not charity, it's justice.
