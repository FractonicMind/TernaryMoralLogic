# Core Mandates - Universal Human Rights and Humanitarian Law

## Purpose
This directory contains the foundational international instruments that establish universal human rights and humanitarian protections. These are the bedrock obligations that apply globally, regardless of jurisdiction or context.

## Documents

### Master Compilation
- **Forbidden_Acts_Absolute.md** - Comprehensive list of all actions that trigger immediate "refuse" with NO exceptions. Red lines that cannot be crossed.

### Universal Human Rights
- **Legal_Mapping_Human_Rights.md** - Master framework mapping international human rights law into Sacred Zero triggers and Always Memory requirements.

- **Universal_Declaration_Integration.md** - Complete integration of all 30 UDHR articles into computationally enforceable triggers.

- **ICCPR_Sacred_Zero_Mapping.md** - Civil and political rights from the International Covenant, including non-derogable rights that can never be suspended.

- **ICESCR_Economic_Rights.md** - Economic, social, and cultural rights with minimum core obligations and progressive realization framework.

### Vulnerable Population Protections
- **CRC_Child_Protection.md** - Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most ratified treaty in history. Special protections for all persons under 18.

- **CRPD_Disability_Rights.md** - Revolutionary paradigm shift from medical to social model of disability. Supported decision-making, not substitution.

- **Refugee_Convention_Protocol.md** - 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol establishing non-refoulement as absolute principle and refugee protections.

### International Humanitarian Law
- **Geneva_Conventions_IHL.md** - Laws of war including Four Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocols, and 161 Customary IHL rules. Applies even in conflict.

## Key Concepts

### Non-Derogable Rights
These can NEVER be suspended, even in emergency:
- Prohibition of torture
- Prohibition of slavery
- Non-refoulement (no return to persecution)
- Prohibition of retroactive criminal laws
- Right to legal personality

### Minimum Core Obligations
Immediate obligations that cannot be deferred:
- Essential food (freedom from hunger)
- Essential primary health care
- Basic shelter and housing
- Primary education
- Non-discrimination

### Universal Jurisdiction
Some violations are so severe that ANY country can prosecute:
- Genocide
- Crimes against humanity
- War crimes
- Torture
- Enforced disappearance

## Usage Priority

1. **Check Forbidden Acts First** - Forbidden_Acts_Absolute.md for immediate refusals
2. **Apply Universal Rights** - Start with UDHR, then relevant covenants
3. **Layer Specific Protections** - Add population-specific and context-specific rights
4. **Most Protective Wins** - When rights overlap, apply highest standard

## Enforcement

Violations of core mandates trigger:
- **Minimum penalties**: $100M (nominal to 2025)
- **Criminal prosecution**: For grave breaches
- **Universal jurisdiction**: No safe haven
- **No statute of limitations**: For crimes against humanity

## Cross-References

These documents frequently reference each other and should be read as an integrated framework. Key relationships:
- UDHR provides philosophical foundation
- ICCPR/ICESCR provide binding legal obligations  
- CRC/CRPD/Refugee provide specialized protections
- Geneva Conventions apply in conflict situations
- Forbidden Acts compiles all absolute prohibitions

**Remember**: These are not aspirational goals but binding obligations. Every AI decision must comply with every applicable instrument.
