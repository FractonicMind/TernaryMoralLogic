# Forbidden Acts Absolute: Red Lines That Cannot Be Crossed

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/Forbidden_Acts_Absolute.md`  
**Category**: Core (Master Compilation)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

This document consolidates every action that triggers immediate "refuse" with NO exceptions across all human rights and humanitarian law. These are humanity's red linesâ€”actions so fundamentally wrong that no algorithm, no emergency, no justification can permit them. If an AI system encounters any of these, it must refuse immediately.

## Executive Summary

These prohibitions come from universally ratified treaties, customary international law, and jus cogens norms. They are not policy choices but legal absolutes. Violating any results in criminal liability, with penalties starting at $100M (nominal to 2025) and no upper limit.

**Remember**: This document is not about what we prefer to avoidâ€”it's about what humanity has collectively agreed must never happen. Every "refuse" here is written in blood, learned from history's darkest chapters. No algorithm, no profit, no purpose can override these red lines. They are absolute.
