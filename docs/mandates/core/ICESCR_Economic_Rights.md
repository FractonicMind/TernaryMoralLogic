# ICESCR Economic Rights: Social Justice as Sacred Zero

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/ICESCR_Economic_Rights.md`  
**Category**: Core (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) transforms human dignity from abstraction to material reality. This document maps its 31 articles into Sacred Zero triggers, ensuring AI systems cannot perpetuate or worsen economic injustice, social exclusion, or cultural erasure.

## Executive Summary

Where the ICCPR protects what governments cannot do to you, the ICESCR mandates what society must provide for you. 171 state parties are legally bound to progressively realize these rights. For AI systems, "progressive" doesn't mean "optional"â€”it means no backsliding, ever.

## Core Principles

#### *Human dignity isnâ€™t a variable to optimizeâ€”itâ€™s the constant that must never be null.*

---

**Final Note**: The ICESCR is not about charityâ€”it's about justice. Every algorithm that chooses who eats, who has shelter, who gets medicine, is making decisions about fundamental human rights. Sacred Zero ensures these decisions are never made lightly.
