# ICCPR Sacred Zero Mapping: Civil and Political Rights Enforcement

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/ICCPR_Sacred_Zero_Mapping.md`  
**Category**: Core (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is legally binding on 173 state parties. This document transforms its 53 articles into executable Sacred Zero triggers, creating enforceable boundaries for AI systems affecting civil liberties and political freedoms.

## Executive Summary

Unlike the aspirational UDHR, the ICCPR creates legal obligations. Every article here carries the force of international law, with monitoring by the UN Human Rights Committee. Violations aren't just unethicalâ€”they're illegal.
