# CRC Child Protection: Sacred Zero for Every Child

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/CRC_Child_Protection.md`  
**Category**: Core (Convention on the Rights of the Child)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is history's most ratified human rights treaty—196 state parties, with only the United States unsigned. This document transforms its 54 articles into Sacred Zero triggers, ensuring AI systems treat every person under 18 with the special protection childhood demands.

## Executive Summary

Children are not mini-adults or future citizens—they are rights-holders now. The CRC establishes that in ALL actions concerning children, their best interests shall be a primary consideration. For AI systems, this means every algorithm touching a child's life must encode protection, participation, and provision as non-negotiable.

**Remember**: Every algorithm that touches a child's life is making decisions about their future. The CRC isn't about protecting children from the world—it's about preparing them for it while keeping them safe. In code, we must balance protection with participation, safety with autonomy, always guided by their best interests.
