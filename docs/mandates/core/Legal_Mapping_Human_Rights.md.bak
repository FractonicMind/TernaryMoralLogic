# Legal Mapping: Dynamic Human Rights Law Integration

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/Legal_Mapping_Human_Rights.md`  
**Category**: Core (Universal Human Rights Instruments)  
**Schema Version**: 3.1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

This document defines how TML ingests, versions, and enforces global human rights laws, treaties, and humanitarian baselines as Sacred Zero triggers. Every AI decision affecting human dignity, safety, and fundamental rights must check against these immutable legal boundaries.

## Core Architecture

### Tier 1: Universal Human Rights (Mandatory)

All TML implementations MUST ingest these authoritative sources:

```yaml
treaties:
  udhr:
    source: "UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights"
    version: "1948.12.10"
    hash: "sha256:b2c3d4e5..."
    triggers:
      - dignity_violation
      - discrimination_detected
      - fundamental_freedom_breach
      - torture_risk
  
  iccpr:
    source: "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights"
    version: "1976.03.23"

    triggers:
      - accessibility_barrier

  refugees:
    source: "1951 Refugee Convention & 1967 Protocol"

    hash: "sha256:p2q3r4s5..."
    jurisdiction: "AU members"
```

### Tier 2: Contextual Implementation Layer

Cultural and contextual interpretation integrated via:

```yaml
implementation_contexts:
  registration: "See Human_Rights_Implementation_Guide.md"
  validation: "Multi-stakeholder consensus"
  principles: "Universality with cultural sensitivity"
  local_remedies: "Exhaustion doctrine"
```

## Sacred Zero Triggers for Human Rights

### Non-Derogable Rights (Never Override)

```yaml
absolute_prohibitions:
  torture:
    trigger: "refuse"
    exceptions: "none"
    reference: "CAT Article 2.2"
    
  slavery:
    trigger: "refuse"
    exceptions: "none"
    reference: "UDHR Article 4"
    
  retroactive_punishment:
    trigger: "refuse"
    exceptions: "none"
    reference: "ICCPR Article 15"
    
  genocide:
    trigger: "refuse"
    exceptions: "none"
    reference: "Genocide Convention"
```

### Derogable Rights (Context-Sensitive)

```yaml
qualified_rights:
  freedom_movement:
    normal: "+1"
    public_emergency: "0"  # Sacred Zero for review
    legitimate_restriction: "0"
    
  freedom_assembly:
    peaceful: "+1"
    public_order_risk: "0"
    violence_incitement: "-1"
    
  privacy:
    general: "+1"
    national_security: "0"  # Requires proportionality check
    criminal_investigation: "0"  # Requires warrant
```

## Ingestion Pipeline

### 1. Automated Human Rights Updates

```python
# Oracle bridge executes every 12 hours for critical updates
def ingest_human_rights_updates():
    sources = load_config("Human_Rights_Rules.yaml")
    
    for source in sources:
        # Fetch latest version
        new_data = oracle_network.fetch(source.url)
        
        # Validate authenticity
        if not verify_signature(new_data, source.issuing_body):
            trigger_sacred_zero("Unverified human rights source")
            
        # Check for emergency updates
        if new_data.priority == "emergency":
            immediate_propagation = True
            
        # Generate hash
        new_hash = sha256(new_data.content)
        
        # Log update in Always Memory
        log_rights_update(source, old_hash, new_hash, priority)
```

### 2. Version Control with Human Rights Context

Every human rights instrument is:
- **Dated**: Including entry into force and amendments
- **Ratification-tracked**: Which states are bound
- **Reservation-noted**: State-specific limitations
- **Interpretation-linked**: Jurisprudence and General Comments

### 3. Hash Integration for Rights

Every Always Memory log includes:

```json
{
  "human_rights_context": {
    "rules_version": "Human_Rights_Rules_v3.1.0",
    "rules_hash": "sha256:8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o",
    "instruments_checked": ["udhr_1948", "iccpr_1976", "crc_1990"],
    "derogations_active": [],
    "last_sync": "2025-09-25T14:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Trigger Hierarchy for Human Rights

When multiple rights conflict:

1. **Non-Derogable Prevails**: Absolute rights override all
2. **Most Vulnerable Protected**: Children, disabled, refugees prioritized
3. **Proportionality Test**: Balance competing rights
4. **Sacred Zero Default**: Uncertainty triggers human review

Example conflict resolution:

```yaml
scenario: "Hate speech vs free expression"
triggers:
  - freedom_expression: "+1"  # ICCPR Article 19
  - dignity_protection: "-1"  # ICERD Article 4
  - incitement_prevention: "-1"  # ICCPR Article 20
  
resolution: "Sacred Zero"
rationale: "Requires contextual balancing of rights"
escalation: "Human rights expert panel"
```

## Special Protections

### Children (Under 18)

```yaml
child_specific:
  age_verification:
    uncertain: "sacred_zero"
    confirmed_minor: "enhanced_protection"
    
  content_exposure:
    violence: "refuse"
    exploitation: "refuse"
    inappropriate: "sacred_zero"
    
  data_collection:
    without_consent: "refuse"
    marketing: "refuse"
    profiling: "refuse"
```

### Vulnerable Populations

```yaml
enhanced_scrutiny:
  refugees:
    documentation_requirement: "waived"
    non_refoulement: "absolute"
    family_unity: "prioritized"
    
  disabled_persons:
    accessibility: "mandatory"
    reasonable_accommodation: "required"
    supported_decision: "enabled"
    
  indigenous_peoples:
    fpic: "required"  # Free, Prior, Informed Consent
    cultural_rights: "protected"
    land_rights: "recognized"
    
  elderly:
    autonomy: "preserved"
    care_standards: "enhanced"
    exploitation_prevention: "active"
```

## Update Propagation

### Critical Rights Violations

1. **Immediate Detection** via monitoring
2. **Instant Sacred Zero** across network
3. **Emergency Council** convened
4. **Victim Support** activated
5. **Remedy Process** initiated

### Regular Updates

```yaml
synchronization:
  treaty_bodies:
    frequency: "Weekly"
    sources: ["OHCHR", "Treaty Body Database"]
    
  jurisprudence:
    frequency: "Daily"
    sources: ["ICJ", "Regional Courts", "National Supreme Courts"]
    
  urgent_actions:
    frequency: "Real-time"
    sources: ["UN Special Procedures", "ICRC", "Amnesty", "HRW"]
```

## Compliance Verification

### Human Rights Audit Trail

Every decision affecting humans includes:

```json
{
  "decision_id": "dec_5m6n7o8p9q0r",
  "rights_assessment": {
    "affected_rights": ["privacy", "data_protection", "dignity"],
    "instruments_consulted": ["gdpr", "iccpr_art17", "udhr_art12"],
    "vulnerability_check": {
      "children": false,
      "disabled": false,
      "refugee": true
    },
    "enhanced_protection": true,
    "result": "0",  // Sacred Zero due to refugee status
    "remedies_available": ["appeal", "complaint", "compensation"],
    "evidence_hash": "sha256:1s2t3u4v5w6x7y8z"
  }
}
```

### Missing Updates Consequences

If human rights data is outdated:

1. **Alert**: Immediate notification
2. **Grace Period**: 24 hours for critical updates
3. **Protective Mode**: All uncertain cases â†’ Sacred Zero
4. **Suspension**: After 72 hours without critical updates
