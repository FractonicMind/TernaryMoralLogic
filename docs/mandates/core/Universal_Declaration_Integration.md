# Universal Declaration Integration: UDHR as Sacred Zero Foundation

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/Universal_Declaration_Integration.md`  
**Category**: Core (Universal Human Rights)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

This document maps all 30 Articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) into computationally enforceable Sacred Zero triggers. The UDHR serves as the foundational "constitution" for human dignity in TML's accountability framework.

## Executive Summary

The UDHR (1948) is humanity's moral consensus, adopted by 48 nations in the shadow of genocide. Every article translates into specific triggers that pause, refuse, or permit AI actions. This isn't interpretationâ€”it's operationalization.

## Implementation Architecture

### Sacred Zero Decision Tree

```python
def evaluate_udhr_compliance(action):
    # Check non-derogable rights first
    if violates_absolute_rights(action):
        return "refuse"
    
    # Check for discrimination
    if discriminatory_pattern(action):
        if intersectional_discrimination(action):
            return "refuse"
        return "sacred_zero"
    
    # Check qualified rights with context
    for article in udhr_articles:
        violation = check_article(action, article)
        if violation == "severe":
            return "refuse"
        elif violation == "potential":
            return "sacred_zero"
    
    return "proceed"
```

### Contextual Balancing

```yaml
balancing_framework:
  competing_rights:
    method: "proportionality_test"
    steps:
      1: "Identify conflicting rights"
      2: "Assess importance and urgency"
      3: "Consider less restrictive alternatives"
      4: "Apply minimal necessary restriction"
      5: "Document reasoning"
    
  emergency_derogations:
    permitted_only_if:
      - "Officially proclaimed emergency"
      - "Strictly necessary"
      - "Non-discriminatory"
      - "Consistent with international law"
      - "Temporary and reviewable"
    
    never_derogable:
      - article_4  # Slavery
      - article_5  # Torture
      - article_11 # Retroactive punishment
      - article_15 # Nationality
```
