# Geneva Conventions IHL: Laws of War as Sacred Zero

**Path**: `/docs/mandates/core/Geneva_Conventions_IHL.md`  
**Category**: Core (International Humanitarian Law)  
**Schema Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25

## Purpose

International Humanitarian Law (IHL) represents humanity's agreement that even war has limits. This document maps the Four Geneva Conventions, their Additional Protocols, and ICRC's 161 Customary IHL rules into Sacred Zero triggers, ensuring AI systems never enable war crimes, protect civilians, and preserve human dignity in conflict.

## Executive Summary

The Geneva Conventions (1949) and their Protocols are universally ratifiedâ€”every nation on Earth is bound by them. Combined with Customary IHL, they form absolute boundaries that no algorithm, no emergency, no military necessity can cross. In war, Sacred Zero becomes a shield for those who cannot fight.

**Remember**: IHL represents humanity's promise that even in our darkest momentsâ€”warâ€”we will not abandon all restraint. Every AI system that touches conflict, that processes military data, that influences targeting, must encode these limits as absolute. In war, Sacred Zero becomes sacred duty.
