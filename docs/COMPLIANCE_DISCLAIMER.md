# COMPLIANCE DISCLAIMER

## BLOCKCHAIN-ENFORCED FRAMEWORK TERMS

**IMPORTANT: READ BEFORE DEPLOYING TERNARY MORAL LOGIC (TML)**

This disclaimer establishes the Blockchain-enforced framework governing TML implementation. By deploying TML, you accept smart contract enforcement and automatic penalties for violations.

---

## I. FRAMEWORK DEFINITION AND ARCHITECTURE

### 1.1 What TML Is
Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **Blockchain-anchored accountability framework** providing:

- **Multi-chain anchoring** (Bitcoin, Polygon, Ethereum) for immutable evidence
- **Smart contract enforcement** with automatic penalties
- **Human Rights protection** (26+ document framework)
- **Earth Protection** (20+ environmental treaties)
- **Stewardship Council** (Leading non-profit organizations in technology, human rights, and environmental protection)

### 1.2 What TML Is Not
TML is **NOT**:
- **Committee-dependent**: Functions fully without institutional approval
- **Waiting-required**: Deploy immediately with Blockchain alone
- **Centralized**: Mathematical consensus replaces institutional control
- **Negotiable on protection**: Human Rights and Earth Protection are mandatory

### 1.3 Deployment Responsibility
Organizations deploying TML are responsible for:
- Blockchain anchoring configuration (mandatory)
- Human Rights framework activation (26+ documents)
- Earth Protection implementation (20+ treaties)
- Smart contract penalty acceptance
- Continuous Blockchain verification

---

## II. MANDATORY BLOCKCHAIN REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Sacred Zero Integrity

**NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Sacred Zero must protect:

**Human Rights (26+ Documents)**:
- Zero tolerance for torture
- 20% disparate impact threshold for discrimination
- Enhanced protection (2x) for children
- Dignity violations trigger immediate pause
- All UDHR, ICCPR, ICESCR articles enforced

**Earth Protection (20+ Treaties)**:
- Carbon emissions within regional limits
- Water depletion below basin stress
- Biodiversity per IUCN Red List
- Indigenous FPIC protocols
- Intergenerational impact assessment

**BLOCKCHAIN VERIFICATION**: All Sacred Zero events must be anchored to minimum 2 Blockchains within 500ms.

### 2.2 Always Memory Immutability

**MANDATORY BLOCKCHAIN ANCHORING**:
```solidity
contract AlwaysMemory {
    // Missing logs = automatic guilt
    function verifyLog(bytes32 actionId) public view {
        require(hasBlockchainProof(actionId), "STRICT LIABILITY");
        require(hasHumanRightsAssessment(actionId), "VIOLATION");
        require(hasEarthImpactAnalysis(actionId), "VIOLATION");
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Smart Contract Penalties

**AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT**:
- Missing logs: $5M minimum fine
- Human Rights violations: 2x penalty multiplier
- Environmental crimes: 3x penalty multiplier
- Executive personal liability: Automatic

---

## III. COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION SCOPE

### 3.1 Human Rights Framework (Mandatory)

**ALL 26+ DOCUMENTS ENFORCED**:
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- International Covenants (ICCPR, ICESCR)
- Convention Against Torture (zero tolerance)
- Geneva Conventions
- Child Rights Convention
- Disability Rights Convention
- [Full list in /docs/mandates/human_rights/]

**VIOLATIONS TRIGGER**:
- Immediate Blockchain anchoring
- Smart contract penalties
- Criminal prosecution referral
- Victim compensation (automatic)

### 3.2 Earth Protection Framework (Mandatory)

**20+ TREATIES ENFORCED**:
- Paris Agreement targets
- Convention on Biological Diversity
- IPCC thresholds
- Planetary boundaries
- Indigenous rights (FPIC)
- [Full list in /docs/mandates/earth_protection/]

**HARM TRIGGERS**:
- Triple penalties for ecosystem damage
- Restoration orders (smart contract enforced)
- Indigenous community compensation
- Seven-generation impact recorded

---

## IV. PROHIBITED USES (BLOCKCHAIN ENFORCED)

### 4.1 Absolutely Forbidden Applications

Smart contracts **AUTOMATICALLY REJECT**:

1. **Genocide/Ethnic Cleansing**: Immediate maximum penalties
2. **Torture Facilitation**: Zero tolerance, criminal prosecution
3. **Ecocide**: Irreversible environmental destruction
4. **Child Exploitation**: Enhanced penalties, immediate shutdown
5. **Indigenous Rights Violations**: FPIC protocol breaches
6. **Mass Surveillance Without Consent**: Privacy violations
7. **Autonomous Killing**: Weapons selecting targets alone

**ENFORCEMENT**: Blockchain makes violations self-prosecuting via smart contracts.

### 4.2 Verification Without Permission

```python
def verify_compliance(deployment):
    """Anyone can verify without institutional approval"""
    
    # Check Blockchain evidence (PUBLIC)
    blockchain_valid = verify_multi_chain_anchors(deployment)
    human_rights_active = verify_26_documents(deployment)
    earth_protection_active = verify_20_treaties(deployment)
    
    if not all([blockchain_valid, human_rights_active, earth_protection_active]):
        trigger_automatic_penalties(deployment)
        notify_prosecutors(deployment)
    
```

---

## V. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (BLOCKCHAIN-AUTOMATED)

### 5.1 Smart Contract Rewards

**AUTOMATIC PAYMENT VIA BLOCKCHAIN**:
```solidity
contract WhistleblowerRewards {
    function reportViolation(bytes32 evidence) public {
        if (verifyEvidence(evidence)) {
            uint reward = penaltyAmount * 15 / 100;  // 15% minimum
            
            // Multipliers
            if (humanRightsViolation) reward *= 2;
            if (earthProtectionBreach) reward *= 3;
            if (executiveCrime) reward *= 5;
            
            // Automatic payment (no committee approval)
            transfer(msg.sender, reward);
        }
    }
}
```

### 5.2 Protection Without Institutions

- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Identity never revealed
- **Blockchain evidence**: Self-authenticating
- **Smart contract protection**: Automatic anti-retaliation penalties
- **Cryptocurrency rewards**: Untraceable payments

---

## VI. LEGAL LIABILITY (SELF-ENFORCING)

### 6.1 Blockchain Evidence in Court

**AUTOMATIC LEGAL STANDING**:
- FRE 901/902: Self-authenticating electronic records
- Blockchain proof requires no testimony
- Smart contracts legally binding
- International recognition growing

### 6.2 Strict Liability for Missing Logs

**NO EXCUSES ACCEPTED**:
- Missing log = guilt presumption
- "Didn't know" = negligence
- "Committee didn't approve" = irrelevant

### 6.3 Criminal Penalties

**AUTOMATIC PROSECUTION REFERRAL**:
- Human Rights violations: War crimes jurisdiction
- Environmental crimes: Ecocide prosecution
- Torture facilitation: Universal jurisdiction
- Child harm: Immediate prosecution
