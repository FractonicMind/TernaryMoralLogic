# COMPLIANCE DISCLAIMER

## LEGAL NOTICE AND FRAMEWORK TERMS

**IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY BEFORE IMPLEMENTING TERNARY MORAL LOGIC (TML)**

This compliance disclaimer establishes the legal framework governing the use of Ternary Moral Logic and its associated Sacred Zero technology. By accessing, implementing, or deploying any component of the TML framework, you acknowledge understanding and acceptance of these terms.

---

## I. FRAMEWORK DEFINITION AND SCOPE

### 1.1 What TML Is
Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **legal-technical framework** for implementing ethical decision-making in artificial intelligence systems. TML provides:

- Architectural patterns for moral reasoning in AI systems
- Standards for Sacred Zero implementation and logging
- Governance structures for accountability and oversight
- Technical specifications for audit trail generation

### 1.2 What TML Is Not
TML is explicitly **NOT**:
- **Software**: TML provides specifications, not executable code
- **Hardware**: TML defines requirements, not physical implementations
- **Consulting Service**: TML offers frameworks, not professional services
- **Legal Advice**: TML establishes standards, not legal recommendations
- **Regulatory Compliance**: TML supplements but does not replace regulatory requirements

### 1.3 Implementation Responsibility
Organizations implementing TML bear full responsibility for:
- Technical implementation meeting TML specifications
- Legal compliance with applicable laws and regulations
- Operational safety and ethical use of AI systems
- Harm prevention and victim compensation
- Staff training and competency verification

---

## II. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Sacred Zero Integrity
**NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENT**: Sacred Zero functionality must operate as specified without:
- Bypass mechanisms that avoid legitimate pause triggers
- Performance optimizations that compromise ethical reasoning
- Manual overrides that prevent threshold-based activation
- Gaming strategies that manipulate risk level calculations

**VIOLATION**: Any implementation that compromises Sacred Zero integrity violates the fundamental terms of TML use and may result in immediate framework license revocation.

### 2.2 Audit Trail Completeness
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: All AI decisions under TML must generate complete, immutable audit trails including:
- Sacred Zero activation triggers and duration
- Moral complexity calculations and reasoning processes
- Human oversight actions and justifications
- Final decision outcomes and implementation details

**DISTRIBUTION**: Audit logs must be distributed to the authorized 11-institution consortium within 24 hours of generation.

### 2.3 Vulnerable Population Protection
**ENHANCED SAFEGUARDS REQUIRED**: Interactions affecting vulnerable populations (children, elderly, disabled, marginalized communities) trigger:
- Reduced Sacred Zero activation thresholds (minimum 50% reduction)
- Additional human oversight requirements
- Specialized review and approval processes
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations

---

## III. PROHIBITED USES AND ABSOLUTE RESTRICTIONS

### 3.1 Prohibited Applications
TML implementation is **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN** for:

1. **Autonomous Weapons**: Any system designed to select and engage targets without human authorization
2. **Mass Surveillance**: Population monitoring without judicial oversight or individual consent
3. **Social Control**: Social credit systems, behavior modification, or population management
4. **Deceptive Manipulation**: Misinformation, deep fakes, or psychological manipulation campaigns
5. **Financial Fraud**: Market manipulation, algorithmic trading fraud, or deceptive financial practices
6. **Medical Override**: Healthcare decisions bypassing licensed physician oversight
7. **Legal Replacement**: Automated legal proceedings without attorney review and approval

### 3.2 Use Case Review
Novel applications not explicitly covered require:
- Community review period (minimum 30 days)
- Expert advisory panel evaluation
- Public comment opportunity
- Ethical impact assessment
- Institutional consortium approval

**VIOLATION**: Use of TML for prohibited applications constitutes a material breach and triggers immediate enforcement action.

**LEGAL PROTECTION**: Complete protection against retaliation including:
- Criminal penalties for retaliation against whistleblowers
- Immediate injunctive relief and civil remedies
- Free legal representation and litigation support
