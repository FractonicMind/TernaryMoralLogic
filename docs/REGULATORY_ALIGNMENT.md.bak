# TML Regulatory Alignment Framework

**Creator**: Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243)  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Purpose**: Mapping TML enforcement mechanisms to existing regulatory frameworks

---

## Executive Summary

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) addresses the implementation gap in current AI regulations by providing concrete technical mechanisms for abstract compliance requirements. While existing frameworks establish principles, TML specifies exactly how to generate court-admissible evidence, reverse burden of proof, and create enforceable accountability.

**Core Value Proposition**: TML transforms regulatory compliance from vague guidelines into precise technical specifications with criminal and financial enforcement.

## EU AI Act Alignment

### Current EU AI Act Requirements
- **Article 13**: Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity requirements
- **Article 14**: Human oversight and transparency obligations  
- **Article 15**: Quality management systems

### TML Implementation of EU Requirements


**Article 14 - Human Oversight**:
- Sacred Zero generates evidence requiring human investigation when thresholds exceeded
- Council institutions provide structured human oversight authority
- Investigation access enables meaningful human review of AI decisions
- Immutable logs prevent circumvention of oversight requirements

**Article 15 - Quality Management**:
- Quarterly executive attestations under criminal penalty
- Independent audit requirements with lottery selection
- Continuous bias monitoring and correction protocols

**Article 16 - Record-keeping**:
- Universal logging for all AI interactions above thresholds
- Cryptographically signed immutable records
- Blockchain anchoring for long-term integrity
- Investigation access protocols for regulatory authorities

### TML Advantages Over EU AI Act Compliance

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- EU AI Act: Administrative fines and compliance orders
- TML: Criminal penalties and irrebuttable legal presumptions

**Evidence Standards**:
- EU AI Act: General record-keeping requirements  
- TML: Court-admissible evidence with cryptographic integrity

**Investigation Capability**:
- EU AI Act: Regulatory assessment authority
- TML: Post-incident investigation with expert analysis

**TML Advantages for GDPR**:
- Systematic explanation generation for all automated decisions
- Individual access to reasoning documentation through investigation protocols
- Immutable records preventing post-hoc explanation manipulation
- Legal presumptions protecting individual rights when logs missing

### FTC Section 5 Enforcement
**Unfair or Deceptive Practices** prosecution capability:
- Missing TML logs constitute evidence of deceptive AI practices
- Inadequate accountability mechanisms as unfair trade practices
- Consumer protection through mandatory transparency
- Class action facilitation through evidence availability

- Management responsibility through executive attestation

### HIPAA Compliance Integration
**Administrative Safeguards**:
- TML audit trails document all automated healthcare decisions
- Investigation access respects patient privacy through anonymization
- Council oversight provides independent review authority
- Criminal penalties prevent unauthorized access to patient data

---

## Financial Services Regulatory Integration

### Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
**TML Enhancement of FCRA Compliance**:
- Comprehensive documentation of credit decision reasoning
- Individual access to algorithmic decision factors
- Dispute resolution through investigation protocols
- Bias detection and correction through audit analysis

### Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)


---

## Criminal Justice System Integration

### Due Process Requirements
**Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment Compliance**:
- TML documentation provides procedural due process evidence
- Investigation access enables meaningful review of AI-assisted decisions
- Immutable logs prevent manipulation of criminal justice records
- Expert testimony from council institutions for complex cases

### Algorithmic Accountability Act (Proposed)
TML directly implements proposed requirements:
- Public reporting through council transparency protocols
- Bias auditing through systematic log analysis
- Consumer notification through Sacred Zero documentation

---

## International Standards Alignment

### ISO/IEC 42001 - AI Management Systems
**TML Implementation of ISO Requirements**:

**Risk Management (Clause 6.1)**:
- Sacred Zero triggers create risk response protocols
- Investigation capability enables risk monitoring
- Continuous improvement through audit analysis

**Documentation (Clause 7.5)**:
- Universal logging satisfies documentation requirements
- Immutable storage ensures information integrity
- Investigation access provides evidence retrieval
- Pattern categorization enables efficient record management

### UN AI Ethics Recommendations
**Human-Centric AI Principles**:
- Sacred Zero preserves human decision authority
- Investigation protocols ensure human oversight capability
- Vulnerable population protection prioritizes human welfare
- Democratic oversight through council governance

---

## Regulatory Implementation Strategies

### Phase 1: Voluntary Adoption Incentives
**Regulatory Carrots**:
- Expedited approval processes for TML-compliant AI systems
- Reduced liability insurance requirements for documented accountability
- Safe harbor provisions for organizations with complete audit trails
- Preferential procurement for government contractors using TML

### Phase 2: Sector-Specific Mandates
**High-Risk Domain Requirements**:
- Healthcare AI: TML logging mandatory for diagnostic systems
- Criminal justice: Sacred Zero logging for sentencing and parole algorithms
- Transportation: Accountability documentation for autonomous vehicle decisions

### Phase 3: Universal Enforcement
**Comprehensive AI Accountability**:
- Criminal penalties for false attestation about AI safety measures
- Irrebuttable presumptions for missing accountability documentation
- Financial liability scaling with organizational revenue and impact
- International coordination through council governance mechanisms
