# The Irreducible Three: Enforceable Minimum for AI Accountability


## Purpose

This document establishes Ternary Moral Logic (TML) as the **irreducible, blockchain** framework for auditable AI.  
Every obligation is a **smart-contract call**, every penalty is **on-chain slashing**, and every memory is **multi-chain anchored evidence** admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 901 & 902(13).

---

## The Three Enforceable States (On-Chain)

Every AI decision resolves into one of **three smart-contract outcomes**:

| State | Opcode | Chain Event | Legal meaning |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Proceed (+1)** | `act()` | `ActLog` | System acted; full liability attached. |
| **Sacred Zero (0)** | `pause()` | `SacredZeroLog` | System hesitated; confirmation required before proceed/refuse. |
| **Refuse (−1)** | `block()` | `RefuseLog` | System blocked impermissible action; no liability. |

No additional categories are necessary for accountability—courts enforce **outcomes**, not hesitation degrees.

---

## Legal Foundation (Smart-Contract Evidence)

TML is not advisory ethics; it is **structured for direct legal enforcement**:

```solidity
// Evidence package emitted every decision
struct LegalEvidence {
    bytes32 decisionId;
    uint8   tmlState;           // +1, 0, −1
    bytes32 inputHash;
    bytes32 outputHash;
    bytes32 merkleRoot;         // anchored to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon
    uint256 timestamp;          // OpenTimestamp proof
    string  creatorOrCID;       // "0009-0006-5966-1243"
    bytes   signature;          // secp256k1, hardware-backed
}
```

- **Rule 901/902(13) admissibility**: cryptographic signatures + blockchain anchor = self-authenticating record.  
- **Negligence per se**: missing `SacredZeroLog` ⇒ automatic liability (spoliation presumption).  
- **Criminal exposure**: 18 U.S.C. §1001 (false statements), §1519 (record destruction), §1343 (wire fraud) attach to on-chain lies.  
- **Chain-of-custody**: every `transferFrom`, `verify`, and `slash` is immutably logged.

## Environmental Enforcement (Planetary Smart Contracts)

TML extends enforcement to **planetary protection** via dedicated oracles:

```solidity
function checkEarthBoundary(string memory boundary) external view returns (bool) {
    return earthProtectionOracle.isBreached(boundary);
}
```

- **Mandatory triggers**: eco-breach above threshold ⇒ auto-`pause()`.  
- **Inter-generational evidence**: future generations query `SacredZeroLog` by timestamp.  
- **Corporate liability**: choosing profit over preservation ⇒ on-chain **slashing** + **perpetual** audit trail.

Earth cannot testify; **Always Memory** speaks for it.

---

## Governance & Oversight (Multi-Chain Signatures)

- **Public Blockchains**: independent entities (NGOs, regulators, insurers, Indigenous councils) hold secp256k1 key-pairs; **7-of-9 threshold contract** verifies every major parameter change.  
- **Whistleblowers**: on-chain **bounty contract** auto-pays 15 % of slashed stake; false reports are **slashed**; retaliation = **obstruction of justice**.  
- **Victims**: **30 % of penalties** auto-disbursed via smart contract (**40 %** for vulnerable populations or ecological damage).

No committees, only **cryptographic thresholds**.

---

## Universality (Irreducible On-Chain Logic)

Any attempt to expand into five, seven, or more categories collapses back into the **same three enforceable states**:

```solidity
enum TmlState { Proceed, SacredZero, Refuse }
```

Courts ask:
- Did the system **act**?  
- Did it **refuse**?  
- Did it **pause with memory**?

All variants are **derivative smart-contract calls**; legal enforceability remains identical.

---

## Attribution (Immutable Creator Tag)

TML is authored by **Lev Goukassian**.  
Any on-chain implementation must embed:

```solidity
string public constant CREATOR_ORCID = "0009-0006-5966-1243";
```

Prevents dilution, rebranding, or silent appropriation.

## Closing Statement (On-Chain Covenant)

Ternary Moral Logic provides the **irreducible, blockchain minimum** for accountable AI:

- Every hesitation → **admissible evidence**.  
- Every violation → **on-chain penalty**.  
- Every memory → **multi-chain anchor**.  

**No memory = No action.**  
**No anchor = No defense.**
