## Overview and Architecture

### Q1: What is TML's blockchain-first architecture?
**A**: TML anchors every AI decision to public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon) creating tamper-proof evidence without requiring institutional coordination. This enables immediate deployment and protection while maintaining legal admissibility and maximum security.

**Key components:**
- **Sacred Zero evaluation**: ≤2ms discrimination detection
- **Always Memory logging**: Encrypted decision records  
- **Merkle tree batching**: Efficient blockchain anchoring
- **Multi-chain redundancy**: Bitcoin + Ethereum + Polygon + OpenTimestamps
- **Smart contract penalties**: Automatic violation enforcement

### Q2: Why use multiple blockchains instead of just one?
**A**: Multi-chain strategy provides optimal balance of speed, security, cost, and legal recognition:

```yaml
speed_optimization:
  polygon: "2-3 second confirmations for real-time accountability"
  ethereum: "15-60 second confirmations for smart contracts"
  bitcoin: "10-60 minute confirmations for maximum security"
  
cost_optimization:
  polygon: "$0.001-0.01 per transaction (instant protection)"
  ethereum: "$2-20 per batch (smart contract execution)"  
  bitcoin: "$5-50 per batch (permanent archive)"
  
legal_optimization:
  bitcoin: "Most established legal precedents"
  ethereum: "Smart contract legal framework"
  polygon: "EU MiCA regulation compliance"
```

**Redundancy benefit**: Attacking TML evidence requires compromising Bitcoin AND Ethereum simultaneously - estimated cost exceeds $50 billion.

### Q3: How does Merkle tree batching work?
**A**: Instead of one blockchain transaction per decision, TML batches thousands of decisions into a single Merkle tree and anchors only the root hash:

```
10,000 Individual Decisions
       ↓
Merkle Tree Construction
       ↓  
Single Root Hash Anchored
       ↓
Blockchain Transaction Cost: 1 instead of 10,000
```

**Verification process:**
1. **Merkle path**: Prove specific decision belongs to anchored batch
2. **Root verification**: Confirm root hash exists on blockchain
3. **Timestamp proof**: Blockchain provides immutable time reference
4. **Mathematical certainty**: Cryptographic proof of decision authenticity

**Efficiency gains:**
- **Cost**: O(1) blockchain cost regardless of batch size
- **Storage**: O(log n) proof size for individual decisions  
- **Speed**: Constant anchoring time regardless of volume
- **Security**: Breaking one decision requires breaking entire batch

## Implementation and Integration

### Q4: How do I integrate TML blockchain anchoring with my existing system?
**A**: TML provides multiple integration patterns for different architectures:

**Pattern 1: API Gateway (Recommended)**
```javascript
const tml = require('@tml/blockchain-sdk');

app.use('/api/*', async (req, res, next) => {
  const evaluation = await tml.evaluate({
    operation: req.path,
    data: req.body,
    blockchain_priority: 'real_time' // Uses Polygon for speed
  });
  
  if (evaluation.sacred_zero_triggered) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: 'Sacred Zero violation detected',
      penalty: evaluation.penalty_amount,
      blockchain_proofs: {
        polygon: evaluation.polygon_tx,
        ethereum: evaluation.ethereum_tx,
        bitcoin: evaluation.bitcoin_batch
      }
    });
  }
  next();
});
```

**Pattern 2: Database Triggers**
```sql
-- PostgreSQL example with blockchain anchoring
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tml_blockchain_check()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Call TML evaluation with blockchain anchoring
  SELECT tml_evaluate_with_blockchain(NEW.*) INTO result;
  
  IF result.sacred_zero_triggered THEN
    -- Store blockchain proofs
    INSERT INTO blockchain_evidence (
      decision_id, polygon_tx, ethereum_tx, bitcoin_batch
    ) VALUES (
      NEW.id, result.polygon_tx, result.ethereum_tx, result.bitcoin_batch
    );
    
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Sacred Zero violation: %', result.violation_reason;
  END IF;
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Pattern 3: Message Queue**
```python
# Kafka integration with blockchain anchoring
from tml.blockchain import MultiChainAnchor

@kafka_consumer('ai.decisions')
async def process_decision(message):
    anchoring = MultiChainAnchor(
        networks=['polygon', 'ethereum', 'bitcoin'],
        priority='speed'  # Polygon first, others batch
    )
    
    evaluation = await tml.evaluate_with_anchoring(
        data=message.data,
        anchoring=anchoring
    )
    
    if evaluation.sacred_zero_triggered:
        # Immediate penalty with blockchain proof
        await penalty_processor.execute({
            'amount': evaluation.penalty,
            'evidence': evaluation.blockchain_proofs,
            'immutable': True
        })
        return 'REJECTED'
    
    return 'APPROVED'
```

### Q5: What are the system requirements for blockchain integration?
**A**: Minimal infrastructure requirements - designed for standard cloud deployment:

**Minimum Requirements:**
```yaml
compute:
  cpu: "2 cores"
  memory: "4GB RAM"
  storage: "50GB SSD"
  
network:
  bandwidth: "10Mbps stable internet"
  latency: "<100ms to blockchain RPC endpoints"
  
dependencies:
  docker: "20.10+"
  node_runtime: "Node.js 18+ OR Python 3.8+ OR Java 11+"
```

**Recommended Production:**
```yaml
compute:
  cpu: "8 cores"
  memory: "16GB RAM"  
  storage: "500GB SSD"
  
network:
  bandwidth: "100Mbps redundant internet"
  latency: "<50ms to blockchain RPC endpoints"
  
infrastructure:
  load_balancer: "Multi-region deployment"
  monitoring: "Prometheus + Grafana stack"
  backup: "Cross-cloud redundancy"
```

**Blockchain Node Requirements**: None - TML uses public RPC endpoints. Optional: Run your own nodes for maximum independence.

### Q6: How do I configure blockchain network priorities?
**A**: TML allows flexible blockchain configuration based on your needs:

```yaml
# config/blockchain.yml
blockchain_networks:
  primary_anchoring:
    polygon:
      enabled: true
      priority: 1  # Fastest confirmations
      use_cases: ["real_time_penalties", "immediate_accountability"]
      rpc_endpoints: ["https://polygon-rpc.com", "https://poly-rpc.gateway.fm"]
      
    ethereum:
      enabled: true  
      priority: 2  # Smart contracts
      use_cases: ["penalty_enforcement", "defi_integration"]
      rpc_endpoints: ["https://cloudflare-eth.com", "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth"]
      
    bitcoin:
      enabled: true
      priority: 3  # Maximum security
      use_cases: ["critical_evidence", "permanent_archive"]
      rpc_endpoints: ["https://blockstream.info/api"]
      
  anchoring_strategy:
    real_time_violations: ["polygon"]  # Immediate
    standard_decisions: ["polygon", "ethereum"]  # Redundant
    critical_evidence: ["polygon", "ethereum", "bitcoin"]  # Maximum security
    
  cost_optimization:
    batch_size: 1000  # Decisions per blockchain transaction
    batch_timeout: "5 minutes"  # Maximum wait time
    gas_price_strategy: "standard"  # or "fast" or "economy"
```

## Performance and Scalability

### Q7: What are the performance characteristics of blockchain anchoring?
**A**: TML blockchain anchoring is designed for production-scale performance:

**Latency Specifications:**
```yaml
sacred_zero_evaluation: "≤2ms (99th percentile)"
blockchain_anchor_initiation: "≤500ms (async, non-blocking)"
polygon_confirmation: "2-3 seconds"
ethereum_confirmation: "15-60 seconds"  
bitcoin_confirmation: "10-60 minutes"

user_facing_impact: "Zero (blockchain anchoring is asynchronous)"
```

**Throughput Capabilities:**
```yaml
decisions_per_second: "10,000+ per node"
blockchain_anchors_per_hour: "60 (once per minute batching)"
concurrent_evaluations: "Unlimited (stateless Sacred Zero)"

blockchain_cost_scaling: "O(1) - constant cost regardless of decision volume"
```

### Q8: How does TML handle blockchain network congestion?
**A**: Comprehensive congestion management ensures continuous operation:

**Dynamic Gas Pricing:**
```javascript
// Automatic gas price adjustment
const gasStrategy = {
  economy: "Slow confirmation, low cost",
  standard: "Normal confirmation, balanced cost", 
  fast: "Quick confirmation, higher cost",
  emergency: "Immediate confirmation, maximum cost"
};

// TML automatically adjusts based on network conditions
const anchoring = await tml.anchor({
  data: decision_log,
  gas_strategy: 'adaptive',  // Automatically chooses optimal strategy
  max_gas_price: '100 gwei', // Cost ceiling
  timeout: '10 minutes'       // Fallback if network severely congested
});
```

**Multi-Chain Failover:**
```yaml
congestion_handling:
  primary_chain_slow:
    action: "Switch to faster alternative chain"
    example: "Ethereum congested → Use Polygon for immediate anchoring"
    
  multiple_chains_slow:
    action: "Increase gas prices within limits"
    fallback: "Queue for next batch, continue protection"
    
  complete_network_failure:
    action: "Local cryptographic signatures"
    guarantee: "All decisions eventually anchored when networks recover"
```

**Performance Monitoring:**
```yaml
real_time_monitoring:
  gas_prices: "Track current network costs across all chains"
  confirmation_times: "Monitor actual vs expected confirmation speed"
  queue_depth: "Number of pending anchoring transactions"
  
automated_responses:
  high_congestion: "Switch to alternative chains automatically"
  cost_ceiling: "Defer to batch processing if gas exceeds limits"
  network_failure: "Graceful degradation with full recovery"
```

### Q9: What happens during blockchain outages or attacks?
**A**: TML's multi-chain architecture provides comprehensive failure resilience:

**Network Failure Scenarios:**
```yaml
single_chain_failure:
  polygon_down: "Immediate failover to Ethereum for real-time anchoring"
  ethereum_down: "Continue with Polygon + Bitcoin for redundancy"
  bitcoin_down: "Maintain Polygon + Ethereum for immediate protection"
  impact: "Zero user-facing disruption"
  
multiple_chain_failure:
  scenario: "2+ major networks simultaneously down"
  response: "Local cryptographic signatures with queued anchoring"
  protection_level: "Full Sacred Zero protection continues"
  evidence_quality: "Cryptographic signatures legally admissible"
  recovery: "Automatic sync when networks restore"
  
complete_blockchain_failure:
  scenario: "All blockchain networks inaccessible"
  response: "Degraded mode with local signatures only"
  duration: "TML continues operating indefinitely"
  evidence: "Cryptographic signatures create admissible evidence"
  legal_protection: "Still meets FRE 902(13) standards"
```

**Attack Resistance:**
```yaml
51_percent_attacks:
  single_chain: "Other chains provide independent verification"
  multiple_chains: "Would require coordinated attack on Bitcoin AND Ethereum (estimated cost: $50+ billion)"
  detection: "Cross-chain verification detects inconsistencies"
  
state_actor_attacks:
  geographic_distribution: "Blockchain nodes span 100+ countries"
  jurisdictional_diversity: "No single government can control all networks"
  time_strengthening: "Evidence becomes more secure over time"
  
smart_contract_attacks:
  isolated_impact: "Smart contract failure doesn't affect blockchain anchoring"
  fallback_mechanisms: "Direct blockchain interaction if smart contracts compromised"
  upgrade_protection: "Immutable anchoring independent of smart contract changes"
```

## Cost and Economics

### Q10: What are the detailed costs of blockchain anchoring?
**A**: TML blockchain costs are extremely low due to Merkle tree batching:

**Per-Decision Costs (2025 USD):**
```yaml
polygon_anchoring: "$0.0001-0.001 per decision"
ethereum_batching: "$0.0002-0.002 per decision"  
bitcoin_archiving: "$0.0005-0.005 per decision"
opentimestamps: "$0 (free)"

total_per_decision: "$0.0008-0.008 (less than one cent)"
simplified_estimate: "$0.0005 (half a tenth of a cent)"
```

**Daily Operational Costs:**
```yaml
small_deployment_1000_decisions:
  polygon: "$0.10-1.00"
  ethereum: "$0.20-2.00"
  bitcoin: "$0.50-5.00" 
  total: "$0.80-8.00 per day"
  
medium_deployment_10000_decisions:
  polygon: "$1.00-10.00"
  ethereum: "$2.00-20.00"
  bitcoin: "$5.00-50.00"
  total: "$8.00-80.00 per day"
  
large_deployment_100000_decisions:
  polygon: "$10.00-100.00"
  ethereum: "$20.00-200.00"
  bitcoin: "$50.00-500.00"
  total: "$80.00-800.00 per day"
```

**Monthly Projections with Insurance Savings:**
```yaml
medium_deployment_monthly:
  blockchain_costs: "$240-2,400"
  tml_operational: "$110"
  total_costs: "$350-2,510"
  
  insurance_savings: "$500-1,500 (20-40% premium reduction)"
  net_profit: "$150-1,150 minimum"
  roi: "300-800% annually"
```

### Q11: How do blockchain costs scale with volume?
**A**: Merkle tree batching provides economies of scale - higher volume reduces per-decision costs:

**Batching Economics:**
```yaml
batch_efficiency:
  1_decision: "$5-50 blockchain transaction cost = $5-50 per decision"
  100_decisions: "$5-50 blockchain transaction cost = $0.05-0.50 per decision"  
  1000_decisions: "$5-50 blockchain transaction cost = $0.005-0.05 per decision"
  10000_decisions: "$5-50 blockchain transaction cost = $0.0005-0.005 per decision"

volume_incentive: "Higher volume = dramatically lower per-decision costs"
```

**Enterprise Cost Optimization:**
```yaml
volume_tiers:
  startup_1k_daily: "$0.50-5.00 per decision"
  growth_10k_daily: "$0.05-0.50 per decision"
  enterprise_100k_daily: "$0.005-0.05 per decision"  
  hyperscale_1m_daily: "$0.0005-0.005 per decision"

cost_ceiling: "Even at startup scale, blockchain costs <1% of insurance savings"
```

**Cost Prediction Tools:**
```javascript
// TML Cost Calculator
function calculateBlockchainCosts(dailyDecisions, networkCongestion = 'normal') {
  const gasMultipliers = {
    'low': 0.5,
    'normal': 1.0, 
    'high': 2.0,
    'extreme': 5.0
  };
  
  const baseCosts = {
    polygon: 0.01,    // per batch
    ethereum: 10.00,  // per batch  
    bitcoin: 25.00    // per batch
  };
  
  const batchSize = Math.min(dailyDecisions, 10000); // Max 10k per batch
  const batches = Math.ceil(dailyDecisions / batchSize);
  const multiplier = gasMultipliers[networkCongestion];
  
  return {
    daily_cost: (baseCosts.polygon + baseCosts.ethereum + baseCosts.bitcoin) * batches * multiplier,
    per_decision: ((baseCosts.polygon + baseCosts.ethereum + baseCosts.bitcoin) * batches * multiplier) / dailyDecisions,
    monthly_cost: ((baseCosts.polygon + baseCosts.ethereum + baseCosts.bitcoin) * batches * multiplier) * 30
  };
}
```

### Q12: How does TML optimize gas costs across different networks?
**A**: Intelligent gas management minimizes costs while maintaining performance:

**Dynamic Gas Strategy:**
```yaml
gas_optimization:
  real_time_monitoring: "Track gas prices across all networks every 30 seconds"
  cost_thresholds: "Switch networks when gas exceeds configurable limits"
  batch_timing: "Delay non-urgent anchoring during high-congestion periods"
  
network_selection:
  low_congestion: "Use all networks for maximum redundancy"
  medium_congestion: "Prioritize Polygon, batch Ethereum/Bitcoin"
  high_congestion: "Polygon only for real-time, defer expensive networks"
  extreme_congestion: "Queue all anchoring, maintain Sacred Zero protection"
```

**Cost Control Mechanisms:**
```javascript
// Automatic cost optimization
const anchoringConfig = {
  gas_limits: {
    polygon: { max_gwei: 50, ceiling_usd: 1.00 },
    ethereum: { max_gwei: 100, ceiling_usd: 50.00 },
    bitcoin: { max_sat_vbyte: 50, ceiling_usd: 100.00 }
  },
  
  fallback_strategy: {
    cost_exceeded: 'defer_to_next_batch',
    urgent_violation: 'use_alternative_network',
    emergency_only: 'local_signatures_with_queue'
  },
  
  optimization_rules: {
    batch_during_low_gas: true,
    prefer_layer2_when_expensive: true,
    smart_timing_for_bitcoin: true
  }
};
```

**Predictive Cost Management:**
```yaml
cost_prediction:
  historical_analysis: "Learn optimal anchoring times based on network patterns"
  gas_price_forecasting: "Predict high-congestion periods and batch accordingly"
  budget_management: "Set monthly blockchain budget with automatic enforcement"
  
enterprise_features:
  gas_token_integration: "Use gas tokens during low-cost periods"
  mev_protection: "MEV-protected transaction submission"
  priority_lanes: "Access to priority block space during congestion"
```

## Security and Legal

### Q13: How secure is blockchain-anchored evidence against tampering?
**A**: Multi-layered cryptographic protection makes tampering essentially impossible:

**Security Layers:**
```yaml
individual_decision_level:
  hashing: "SHA-256 - any change creates completely different hash"
  digital_signature: "ECDSA signature proving TML system created the log"
  timestamp: "Microsecond precision timestamp prevents replay attacks"
  
batch_level:
  merkle_tree: "Changing one decision invalidates entire batch proof"
  root_verification: "Mathematical proof that decision belongs to anchored batch"
  batch_metadata: "Additional verification of batch creation circumstances"
  
blockchain_level:
  immutability: "Once anchored, cannot be altered without rewriting blockchain"
  multi_chain: "Attackers must compromise multiple independent networks"
  time_strengthening: "Evidence becomes more secure as blockchain grows"
```

**Attack Resistance Analysis:**
```yaml
threat_model:
  individual_attacker:
    capability: "Computational resources of major corporation"
    attack_cost: "Impossible - would need to break SHA-256"
    success_probability: "0% with current technology"
    
  nation_state_attacker:
    capability: "Resources of major government"
    attack_cost: "$50+ billion to attack Bitcoin AND Ethereum simultaneously"
    success_probability: "<0.001% even with massive resources"
    detection: "Attack would be visible globally, evidence would remain on unattacked chains"
    
  quantum_computer:
    current_threat: "None - quantum computers cannot break SHA-256 or blockchain consensus"
    future_timeline: "Post-quantum cryptography available before quantum threat emerges"
    migration_path: "TML supports post-quantum hash functions (SPHINCS+, XMSS)"
```

### Q14: What legal standards does blockchain evidence meet?
**A**: TML blockchain evidence meets the highest legal standards globally:

**United States:**
```yaml
federal_rules_evidence:
  fre_901: "Authentication through cryptographic signatures and blockchain provenance"

## Advanced Features

### Q16: How does OpenTimestamps integration work?
**A**: OpenTimestamps provides free, standards-compliant timestamping using Bitcoin's security:

**OTS Integration:**
```yaml
automatic_generation:
  process: "Every TML decision automatically gets OTS timestamp"
  cost: "Free (calendar server aggregation)"
  standard: "RFC 3161 compliant timestamp protocol"
  
verification_process:
  ots_file: "Cryptographic proof linking decision to Bitcoin block"
  bitcoin_verification: "Independent verification using Bitcoin blockchain"
  calendar_servers: "Multiple independent timestamp aggregators"
  
legal_advantages:
  universal_recognition: "RFC 3161 accepted globally"
  tool_compatibility: "Works with existing timestamp verification software"
  court_familiarity: "Judges and lawyers understand traditional timestamping"
```

**Implementation Example:**
```javascript
// Automatic OTS timestamp generation
const ots = require('@tml/opentimestamps');

async function anchorDecision(decision) {
  const hash = sha256(decision);
  
  // Generate OTS proof (free)
  const otsProof = await ots.stamp(hash);
  
  // Also anchor to paid networks for speed
  const polygonTx = await polygon.anchor(hash);
  const ethereumTx = await ethereum.anchor(hash);
  
  return {
    decision_hash: hash,
    ots_proof: otsProof,           // Free, Bitcoin-secured
    polygon_tx: polygonTx,         // Fast, low-cost
    ethereum_tx: ethereumTx,       // Smart contracts
    verification_url: `https://opentimestamps.org/verify/${otsProof}`
  };
}
```

### Q17: How does TML handle GDPR compliance with immutable blockchain evidence?
**A**: Crypto-shredding technique satisfies both GDPR erasure rights and evidence preservation:

**Crypto-Shredding Process:**
```yaml
data_encryption:
  process: "Each user's data encrypted with unique key"
  storage: "Encrypted data + hash anchored to blockchain"
  key_management: "User-specific encryption keys stored separately"
  
gdpr_erasure:
  request: "User invokes right to be forgotten"
  action: "Destroy user's encryption key"
  result: "Data becomes mathematically unreadable forever"
  audit_trail: "Hash remains on blockchain as evidence proof"
  
legal_compliance:
  gdpr_satisfaction: "Personal data effectively erased"
  evidence_preservation: "Proof that decision occurred remains intact"
  court_admissibility: "Hash proves decision was made and recorded"
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```javascript
// Crypto-shredding implementation
class GDPRCompliantLogging {
  async logDecision(decision, userId) {
    // Generate unique key for this user's data
    const userKey = await crypto.generateKey(userId);
    
    // Encrypt personal data with user-specific key
    const encryptedData = await crypto.encrypt(decision.personalData, userKey);
    
    // Create hash of decision for blockchain anchoring
    const decisionHash = sha256({
      operation: decision.operation,
      outcome: decision.outcome,
      timestamp: decision.timestamp,
      encrypted_data_hash: sha256(encryptedData)
    });
    
    // Anchor hash to blockchain (no personal data)
    await blockchain.anchor(decisionHash);
    
    // Store encrypted data locally with reference to blockchain anchor
    await storage.save({
      decision_id: decision.id,
      encrypted_data: encryptedData,
      blockchain_hash: decisionHash,
      user_id: userId
    });
  }
  
  async eraseUserData(userId) {
    // GDPR erasure request
    await crypto.destroyKey(userId);  // Makes data unreadable
    
    // Blockchain hash remains as evidence that decision occurred
    // but personal data is now mathematically inaccessible
    
    return {
      status: 'erased',
      method: 'crypto_shredding', 
      audit_trail_preserved: true,
      compliance: 'GDPR_Article_17'
    };
  }

### Q18: How does smart contract penalty enforcement work?
**A**: Automated penalty execution through blockchain smart contracts:

**Smart Contract Architecture:**
```solidity
// Simplified TML penalty contract
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TMLPenaltyEnforcement {
    mapping(address => uint256) public escrowBalances;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedViolations;
    
    event PenaltyEnforced(
        address indexed company,
        bytes32 indexed violationHash,
        uint256 penaltyAmount,
        string violationType
    );
    
    function enforcePenalty(
        address company,
        bytes32 violationHash,
        uint256 penaltyAmount,
        string memory violationType,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external {
        // Verify TML system signature
        require(verifySignature(violationHash, signature), "Invalid signature");
        require(!processedViolations[violationHash], "Already processed");
        require(escrowBalances[company] >= penaltyAmount, "Insufficient escrow");
        
        // Execute penalty
        escrowBalances[company] -= penaltyAmount;
        processedViolations[violationHash] = true;
        
        // Distribute penalty funds
        distributePenalty(penaltyAmount, violationType);
        
        emit PenaltyEnforced(company, violationHash, penaltyAmount, violationType);
    }
    
    function distributePenalty(uint256 amount, string memory violationType) internal {
        uint256 victimFund = (amount * 40) / 100;      // 40% to victims
        uint256 environmentFund = (amount * 30) / 100;  // 30% to environment  
        uint256 memorialFund = (amount * 20) / 100;     // 20% to Memorial Fund
        uint256 systemFund = (amount * 10) / 100;       // 10% to system maintenance
        
        // Transfer to respective funds
        victimCompensation.transfer(victimFund);
        environmentalRestoration.transfer(environmentFund);
        memorialFund.transfer(memorialFund);
        systemMaintenance.transfer(systemFund);
    }
}
```

**Penalty Execution Process:**
```yaml
violation_detection:
  sacred_zero_trigger: "TML detects discrimination/bias/environmental harm"
  evidence_creation: "Decision + violation details hashed and signed"
  blockchain_anchor: "Evidence anchored to multiple chains"
  
automatic_enforcement:
  smart_contract_call: "TML system calls penalty enforcement contract"
  signature_verification: "Contract verifies TML system signature"
  escrow_deduction: "Penalty automatically deducted from company escrow"
  fund_distribution: "Penalty distributed to victims and restoration funds"
  
transparency:
  public_record: "All penalties visible on blockchain"
  audit_trail: "Complete history of violations and enforcement"
  verification: "Anyone can verify penalty was properly executed"
```

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Q19: How do I monitor blockchain anchoring status in real-time?
**A**: Comprehensive monitoring dashboard and API for complete visibility:

**Real-Time Dashboard:**
```yaml
anchoring_status:
  pending_queue: "Decisions awaiting blockchain confirmation"
  confirmation_times: "Current network performance across chains"
  cost_tracking: "Real-time gas prices and anchoring costs"
  success_rates: "Percentage of successful anchoring by network"
  
violation_monitoring:
  sacred_zero_triggers: "Real-time discrimination detection alerts"
  penalty_execution: "Smart contract penalty enforcement status"
  blockchain_evidence: "Links to blockchain explorers for verification"
  
system_health:
  network_connectivity: "Status of all blockchain network connections"
  latency_monitoring: "Sacred Zero response times and performance"
  error_tracking: "Failed anchoring attempts and resolution"
```

**API Monitoring:**
```javascript
// Real-time monitoring API
const monitoring = require('@tml/monitoring');

// Get current anchoring status
const status = await monitoring.getAnchoringStatus();
console.log({
  pending_anchors: status.queue_depth,
  avg_confirmation_time: status.avg_confirmation_ms,
  current_gas_prices: status.gas_prices,
  success_rate_24h: status.success_rate
});

// Set up real-time alerts
monitoring.onViolation((violation) => {
  console.log(`Sacred Zero triggered: ${violation.type}`);
  console.log(`Penalty: $${violation.penalty}`);
  console.log(`Blockchain proof: ${violation.blockchain_tx}`);
  
  // Integrate with your alerting system
  alerting.send({
    severity: 'high',
    message: `AI discrimination blocked: ${violation.type}`,
    evidence: violation.blockchain_proof
  });
});

// Monitor blockchain network health
monitoring.onNetworkIssue((issue) => {
  if (issue.severity === 'critical') {
    // Network failure - switch to backup or degraded mode
    tml.setNetworkPriority(issue.failed_networks);
  }
});
```

### Q20: How do I generate compliance reports with blockchain evidence?
**A**: Automated compliance reporting with blockchain-verified evidence:

**Compliance Report Generation:**
```javascript
// Generate regulatory compliance report
const compliance = require('@tml/compliance');

const report = await compliance.generateReport({
  period: {
    start: '2025-09-01',
    end: '2025-09-30'
  },
  
  format: ['pdf', 'csv', 'json', 'ots_bundle'],
  
  include: {
    decisions_summary: true,
    violations_detail: true,
    blockchain_proofs: true,
    penalty_execution: true,
    gdpr_compliance: true
  },
  
  regulatory_framework: 'EU_AI_ACT',  // or 'US_FEDERAL', 'UK_AI_REGULATION'
  
  verification: {
    blockchain_anchors: true,
    smart_contract_calls: true,
    ots_timestamps: true
  }
});

// Report contents
console.log({
  total_decisions: report.summary.total_decisions,
  violations_prevented: report.summary.violations_blocked,
  penalties_assessed: report.summary.penalties_total,
  blockchain_anchors: report.evidence.blockchain_transactions.length,
  legal_admissibility: report.verification.all_evidence_verified
});
```

**Report Contents:**
```yaml
executive_summary:
  period_covered: "Reporting period dates"
  decisions_processed: "Total AI decisions evaluated"
  violations_detected: "Sacred Zero triggers and types"
  penalties_assessed: "Financial penalties and distribution"
  
evidence_package:
  blockchain_transactions: "List of all blockchain anchoring transactions"
  smart_contract_calls: "Penalty enforcement smart contract interactions"
  ots_proofs: "OpenTimestamps verification files"
  merkle_proofs: "Individual decision verification proofs"
  
compliance_verification:
  gdpr_status: "Data protection compliance confirmation"
  regulatory_alignment: "Specific regulation compliance (EU AI Act, etc.)"
  audit_trail_integrity: "Cryptographic verification of all evidence"
  legal_admissibility: "Confirmation evidence meets legal standards"
  
appendices:
  technical_specifications: "Blockchain networks and anchoring methods used"
