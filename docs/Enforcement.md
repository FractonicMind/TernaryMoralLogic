## Purpose

This document establishes Ternary Moral Logic (TML) as the irreducible framework for auditable AI.  
It is written as a compliance and governance reference.  
The goal is clarity, enforceability, and legal precision.  

---

## The Three Enforceable States

Every AI decision ultimately resolves into one of three outcomes:

- **Proceed (+1):** The system acts.  
- **Sacred Zero (0):** The system hesitates, creates an Always Memory log, and awaits confirmation.  
- **Refuse (−1):** The system blocks an impermissible action.  

No additional categories are necessary for accountability.  
Courts and regulators cannot enforce "degrees of hesitation."  
They can only enforce outcomes.  

This makes TML the **irreducible minimum**: act, pause with memory, or refuse.  

---

## Legal Foundation

TML is not advisory ethics.  
It is structured for direct integration with law:

- **Evidence law:** Always Memory logs are admissible under Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 901 for authentication, Rule 902 for self-authenticating digital records, Rule 803(6) for business records).  
- **Liability:** Missing memories shift responsibility to the deploying organization. No memory = automatic negligence.  
- **Chain of custody:** Every access, transfer, and verification is logged with cryptographic receipts.  
- **Penalties:** False statements (18 U.S.C. §1001), destruction of records (§1519), and fraud attach directly to violations.  

This framework ensures that Sacred Zero is not symbolic.  
It is operational evidence with binding legal force.

## Environmental Enforcement

TML extends enforcement to planetary protection:

- **Mandatory triggers:** Environmental harm above thresholds triggers Sacred Zero.  
- **Intergenerational evidence:** Future generations can query historical environmental decisions.  
- **Corporate liability:** Algorithms that chose profit over preservation face perpetual accountability.  

Earth cannot testify. Always Memory speaks for it.

---

## Governance and Oversight

- **Guardian Network:** Independent institutions hold, verify, and protect memories across jurisdictions.  
- **Whistleblowers:** Protected and compensated (15% of penalties). False reports are penalized. Retaliation is treated as obstruction of justice.  
- **Victims:** Minimum 30% of penalties allocated to victims (40% for vulnerable populations or environmental damage).  

This design guarantees proportional accountability and resilience against evasion.  

---

## Universality

Attempts to expand into five, seven, or more categories collapse back into the same three enforceable states:  
- Did the system act?  
- Did it refuse?  
- Did it trigger Sacred Zero and generate memory?  

TML defines the boundary conditions.  
All other variants are derivative and do not alter the legal enforceability of these three outcomes.  

---

## Attribution

TML is authored and validated by **Lev Goukassian**.  
Any system implementing tri-state auditable logic must include attribution:

- **Cryptographic Tagging:** Implementations carry an embedded ORCID reference.  
- **Always Memory:** Every log contains the Goukassian Promise elements.  

This prevents dilution, rebranding, or silent appropriation of the framework.  

---

## Closing Statement

Ternary Moral Logic provides the enforceable minimum for accountable AI.  
It converts ethical hesitation into admissible evidence.  
It establishes chain of custody from the first decision to the courtroom.  
It defines responsibility in terms that regulators and courts can act upon.  

The framework is clear:  
- TML is authored.  
- TML is irreducible.  
- TML is enforceable.  
- TML protects both humanity and Earth.  

**No memory = No action.**
