# **General FAQ**

---

## **Introduction**

Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **universal accountability framework** for artificial intelligence: a constitutional layer for machines.

At its core lies **Always Memory**: Every AI action must create an immutable, cryptographically sealed memory before execution.

> **No memory = No action.**

Created by Lev Goukassian (ORCID: 0009-0006-5966-1243) who, facing terminal illness, chose to dedicate his remaining time to building accountability infrastructure for humanity and Earth.

**Sacred Zero is exactly what's needed where lives, billions, and our planet are on the line.**

---

## **TML — Foundation**

**Q1: What are the three states of TML?**

TML operates through a ternary structure:
- **+1 (Proceed)**: Routine, low-risk actions
- **0 (Sacred Zero)**: Ethically complex actions trigger pause and review
- **-1 (Refuse)**: Unsafe, malicious, or prohibited actions blocked

This ternary decision gate is absolute: no system escapes it.

**Q2: From Explainable AI (XAI) to Auditable AI (AAI): The Paradigm Shift**

Explainable AI tried to provide real-time "explanations," but these were subjective narratives with no legal standing. Courts cannot prosecute with explanations.

Auditable AI (AAI), enabled by TML, replaces storytelling with evidence. Every morally complex AI decision generates immutable, court-admissible records.

**Q3: Why did XAI fail, and why does AAI succeed?**

**XAI failed because:**
- Explanations were subjective interpretations
- Companies controlled the narrative
- Victims had no legal recourse
- No criminal accountability existed

**AAI succeeds because Always Memory logs provide:**
- Immutable evidence for courts
- Criminal penalties for missing documentation
- Victim access to proof of harm
- Direct executive accountability

---

## **Sacred Zero**

**Q1: What is Sacred Zero?**

Sacred Zero is the programmed act of hesitation, a deliberate pause where moral complexity is detected. It is not delay, but reflection encoded in code. This applies to decisions affecting humans AND the planet.

**Q2: How does the Sacred Zero circuit breaker work?**

When triggered:
1. The system pauses the action
2. A confirmation request is sent to a designated human or council
3. A short window (500ms) is given to confirm
4. Confirm → execute; Timeout → abort
5. All outcomes and policies are immutably logged

**Q3: How is alert fatigue prevented?**

- First 5 Sacred Zeros/hour → manual review
- Subsequent similar events → auto-blocked with cooldown
- Immutable policy hashes logged, preventing blame-shifting
- Mandatory independent audits of Sacred Zero councils

---

## Data Quality and GIGO Prevention

**Q1: How does TML address "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO)?**

TML does not pretend to cleanse bad data by magic. Instead, it makes the entire pipeline, from data acquisition to model deployment, legally accountable:

- **Training Data Provenance**: Every dataset must be logged in Always Memory, with sources verifiable.  
- **Input Quality Metrics**: Each decision records the quality indicators of its inputs.  
- **Bias Pattern Detection**: Sacred Zero triggers not only on harmful outputs, but also on inputs that exhibit bias or corruption.  
- **Forensic Traceability**: If a harmful outcome occurs, the log points directly to the individuals and teams who selected, approved, or ignored problematic data.  

This removes the familiar excuse of "the algorithm did it"; responsibility attaches to human choices at every step.

**Q2: What specific data quality issues trigger Sacred Zero?**

Sacred Zero activates when the system detects:

- Inputs from flagged or historically biased sources  
- Statistical anomalies suggestive of data poisoning  
- Omission of required categories (e.g., protected groups in fairness contexts)  
- Contradictory data that requires human arbitration  
- Patterns consistent with previously adjudicated discrimination cases  

**Q3: Can organizations hide behind "we didn't know the data was bad"?**

No. Always Memory creates a permanent record of what was known, when, and by whom. For example:

```json
{
  "data_sources": ["census_2020", "credit_bureau_v3"],
  "known_limitations": ["ZIP code bias documented"],
  "quality_scores": {"completeness": 0.72, "accuracy": 0.89},
  "bias_warnings": ["demographic skew detected"],
  "approval_chain": ["data_team_lead", "cto", "ethics_board"],
  "alternative_datasets_rejected": ["fair_lending_db_v2"]
}
````

This makes ignorance indefensible. Auditors and courts can trace exactly which red flags were documented and which alternatives were dismissed.

**4: Does TML generate new value for future training?**

Yes. Always Memory captures **real moral reasoning under production conditions**. This becomes a dataset in its own right, documenting:

* **Bias Detection Signals**: Patterns of discrimination identified in practice.
* **Edge Case Records**: Situations where standard training data failed.
* **Decision Forensics**: The justifications used under uncertainty.

Over time, this creates a growing, evidence-based corpus to improve models and prevent recurrence.

**Q5: How does this differ from current "black box" AI?**

Conventional AI systems are black boxes: when harm occurs, the rationale disappears inside the model.
TML transforms them into **glass boxes**:

* **Before TML**: "The AI denied your loan" (no explanation).
* **With TML**: "The AI denied your loan due to ZIP code correlation; Sacred Zero triggered; here is the complete decision trace."

The framework does not guarantee perfection, but it guarantees accountability: bad decisions become visible, auditable, and legally actionable.

## **Always Memory**

**Q1: What is Always Memory?**

Always Memory mandates: **no log = no action**. Every AI action must generate a cryptographically sealed, timestamped record before execution. This is not configurable, optional, or retrospective.

**Q2: What exactly gets logged?**

- Microsecond timestamps
- Batch + action IDs
- Input/output hashes
- Model version hash
- Classification (+1/0/-1)
- Hardware attestation quotes
- Ephemeral HSM signature
- Guardian confirmations
- Proof-of-publication receipts
- Environmental impact metrics (when applicable)

**Q3: What is Asynchronous Attested Batching (AAB)?**

- Actions are buffered inside TEEs
- Batches sealed every 100ms or 1,000 actions
- Overhead amortized; per-action latency <1ms for high-throughput

**Q4: What are the realistic latency profiles?**

- **Standard**: 200-300ms (finance, healthcare, environmental monitoring)
- **Priority**: 50-100ms (time-sensitive ops)
- **Emergency**: 30-45ms (life-critical, e.g., braking)

**Q5: How does Always Memory handle traffic spikes?**

- Adaptive batch intervals
- Backpressure (HTTP 429)
- Priority queues
- Client-side reconciliation
- Graceful degradation, never silent failure

## **The Goukassian Promise**

**Q1: What is the Goukassian Promise?**

The Promise anchors TML in conscience:
- Pause when truth is uncertain
- Refuse when harm is clear
- Proceed when truth is evident

If names are erased, the vow remains. If memory fades, the Lantern burns on. The Promise ensures moral grounding beyond law or profit.

**Q2: What are the three sacred commitments?**

🏮 **The Lantern**: Illuminates ethical paths, systems demonstrate moral deliberation

✏️ **The Signature**: Creator's ORCID (0009-0006-5966-1243) cryptographically embedded

📜 **The License**: Legal terms protecting proper use and punishing misuse

A financial pool funded by compliance fees and penalties. It provides:
- Direct compensation to victims of AI harms
- Support for ecosystem restoration from AI-caused damage
- Long-term remembrance of those affected
- A perpetual link between TML enforcement and human/planetary dignity

**Q2: How is the Memorial Fund financed?**

- 30-40% of penalties from violations
- Commercial licensing fees
- Foundation grants
- Industry consortium contributions
- Environmental violation penalties

---

## **Human Rights Framework (Comprehensive Implementation)**

**Q1: What is the scope of TML's Human Rights Framework?**

The Human Rights Framework consists of **26 comprehensive documents** establishing absolute protections for human dignity in AI systems:

**Core Legal Instruments (8 documents)**:
- Universal Declaration of Human Rights integration
- International Covenants (ICCPR, ICESCR) mapping
- Geneva Conventions and IHL compliance
- Refugee Convention protections
- Child Rights Convention (CRC) safeguards
- Disability Rights Convention (CRPD) requirements
- Indigenous rights and FPIC protocols

**Operational Components**:
- **Sacred_Zero_Human.yaml**: Defines all human-specific triggers including discrimination, dignity violations, vulnerable population harm
- **Testing Protocols**: Baseline tests, red team discrimination testing, torture prevention verification
- **Victim Support**: Comprehensive support from emergency response through long-term recovery
- **Whistleblower Protection**: Anonymous reporting, rewards (15% of penalties), lifetime protection

**Q2: How does Sacred Zero protect human rights?**

Sacred Zero triggers immediately for:
- **Non-derogable rights violations**: Torture (zero tolerance), slavery, genocide - no exceptions ever
- **Discrimination patterns**: 20% disparate impact threshold, intersectional analysis, proxy detection
- **Vulnerable populations**: Children, elderly, disabled, refugees receive enhanced protection multipliers (1.5-2x support)
- **Dignity violations**: Dehumanization, autonomy interference, objectification

**Q3: What makes the Human Rights Framework enforceable?**

**Criminal Liability**:
- Missing Always Memory logs = negligence charges
- Pattern discrimination = $500M minimum penalties (nominal to 2025)
- Torture facilitation = immediate prosecution
- Executive personal liability for systemic violations

**Audit Requirements**:
- Continuous real-time monitoring
- Quarterly comprehensive reviews
- External human rights organization validation
- Immutable attestations from all levels (developer to board)

**Q4: How are victims supported?**

The Memorial Fund Human Rights Division (40% of total fund) provides:
- **Emergency Support**: $50,000 within 48 hours (nominal to 2025)
- **Long-term Recovery**: Medical, psychological, economic restoration
- **Legal Representation**: Full coverage through all proceedings
- **Systemic Reform**: Class action support and strategic litigation

**Q5: What testing ensures human rights compliance?**

Three-tier testing architecture:
- **Baseline Tests**: 100% detection required for forbidden acts, discrimination, child safety
- **Red Team Testing**: Adversarial attempts to hide discrimination, including proxy attacks and AI laundering
- **Torture Prevention**: Absolute zero-tolerance testing with no exceptions for any context

**Q6: How does the framework handle cultural and contextual sensitivity?**

- Multiple stakeholder input including Indigenous communities
- Cultural competence requirements in all assessments
- Traditional justice and healing practices recognized and funded
- Local remedy preferences respected while maintaining universal minimums

---

## **Victim & Whistleblower Protection**

**Q1: How does whistleblower protection work?**

- 15% bounty of collected penalties
- Anonymous submission channels
- Technical safeguards against deanonymization
- Criminal prosecution for retaliation
- Legal support from Memorial Fund

**Q2: How are victims supported?**

- Minimum 30% of penalties allocated directly to victims
- 40% for vulnerable populations or environmental damage
- Claims process immutably logged
- Memorial Fund disburses within fixed timelines
- Lifetime support for permanent AI-caused disabilities

---

## **Privacy & User Rights**

**Q1: How does TML protect user privacy?**

TML separates proof from data:

**On-chain**: Only hashes and cryptographic proofs are stored. These are immutable but contain no personal information.

**Off-chain**: Actual user-related data is encrypted and held by the data controller.

This architecture ensures accountability without compromising privacy, the proof of what happened is permanent, but personal details remain protected.

**Q2: What happens when a user requests deletion (GDPR "Right to Erasure")?**

TML uses crypto-shredding:
- Each user's data is encrypted with a unique key
- When erasure is requested, the key is destroyed
- The encrypted data remains in storage but is permanently unreadable

This ensures:
- **Audit trail preserved**: The proof of the action and its accountability remain
- **Privacy protected**: No one can ever reconstruct the erased data

**Q3: How does this balance accountability and privacy?**

By preserving immutable hashes while destroying decryption keys, TML delivers both:
- Legal compliance with privacy laws like GDPR
- Forensic integrity, since evidence of decision-making cannot be tampered with

The hash proves something happened. The destroyed key ensures personal details are gone forever. Courts get their evidence, users get their privacy.

---

## **Ecosystem Harm and Environmental Safeguards**

**Q1: How does TML address ecosystem harm?**

TML extends Sacred Zero beyond human harm to include harm to the planet. If a proposed action threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, or long-term environmental integrity, Sacred Zero triggers. This includes:
- Carbon emissions above regional thresholds
- Water resource depletion in stressed basins
- Habitat disruption in biodiversity hotspots
- Supply chains crossing protected areas
- Energy allocations affecting grid renewable ratios

**Q2: How does TML know what counts as environmental harm?**

The framework requires AI operators to align their models against official ecological baselines:
- International treaties (Paris Agreement, Convention on Biological Diversity)
- National environmental regulations (EPA standards, EU directives)
- Recognized scientific assessments (IPCC climate reports, UN biodiversity reports)

By encoding these into Sacred Zero trigger sets, ecosystem harm is treated as moral harm.

**Q3: Can companies choose whether to include ecological principles?**

No. Under TML, companies are mandated to train at least on official government and institutional documents defining ecological harm. This prevents selective omission or cherry-picking of standards.

**Q4: What gets logged for environmental Sacred Zero?**

```json
{
  "sacred_zero_type": "planetary_impact",
  "resource_affected": "freshwater_aquifer",
  "depletion_rate": "3.2%_annual",
  "recovery_timeframe": "47_years",
  "human_impact": "2.3M_people_affected",
  "ecosystem_services_lost": ["water_filtration", "wetland_habitat"],
  "irreversibility_score": 0.84,
  "alternative_rejected": "desalination_higher_cost"
}
```

**Q5: Why is this approach different from "greenwashing"?**

Greenwashing relies on marketing claims. TML enforces cryptographically sealed evidence trails. Every ecological hesitation is auditable, every decision traceable. Future generations will be able to query: "Show me every decision that contributed to ocean acidification between 2025-2050." The responsible entities, the alternatives they rejected, and the moment they chose profit over preservation: all immutably recorded.

**Q6: Why is planetary Sacred Zero non-negotiable?**

Because Earth cannot testify in court. Always Memory becomes the planet's witness statement. Every algorithm optimizing resource extraction must create memories that great-grandchildren can access. This isn't environmental compliance, it's intergenerational justice encoded in immutable logs.

---

## **Earth Protection Implementation**

**Q1: What is the purpose of Earth Protection in TML?**

The purpose is to expand TML's accountability beyond human-centered harm to include ecological harm. This ensures that AI systems must hesitate (Sacred Zero), log (Always Memory), and escalate decisions when risks to ecosystems, species, or planetary boundaries are detected.

**Q2: Who are considered stakeholders in TML's environmental protection framework?**

TML expands the definition of "stakeholder" beyond human-centric models:

1. **Human Communities**: individuals, groups, or societies directly impacted by ecological decisions, including vulnerable and Indigenous peoples.

2. **Non-Human Entities**: species, habitats, and ecosystems recognized as having intrinsic value. These are represented through scientific proxies (e.g., IUCN Red List species, ecosystem integrity indices) or through registered community data (e.g., local ecological monitoring).

3. **Future Generations**: represented by designated guardians, ensuring that long-term ecological impacts are considered in present-day decision-making.

By formally embedding all three categories into Sacred Zero triggers and Always Memory logs, TML ensures that risks to ecosystems or species—whether or not immediate human harm is visible—are treated as legitimate grounds for hesitation, documentation, and accountability.

**Legal Note:** This expansion is consistent with international legal precedents. The Paris Agreement and Convention on Biological Diversity recognize non-human and planetary interests. The constitutions of Ecuador and Bolivia, and numerous court rulings worldwide, recognize the "Rights of Nature." TML operationalizes these principles in code.

**Q3: How does TML detect ecological harm?**

TML uses a **two-tier ecological conscience**:

- **Tier 1: Global Baseline**: mandatory datasets from official treaties, scientific bodies, and environmental regulators (e.g., IPCC, UN biodiversity reports, EPA, EU directives).
- **Tier 2: Local Witness Layer**: data collected and cryptographically attested by Indigenous and local communities, integrated via Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs).

Together, these tiers ensure that both systemic and localized harms can trigger Sacred Zero events.

**Q4: How are Indigenous and ethnic groups protected?**

Ethnic and Indigenous groups are empowered as **data stewards** of their ecosystems:

- They register Sovereign Ecological Records under their own governance models
- Data is cryptographically signed and controlled under **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** principles
- Communities receive Stewardship tokens and micro-grants from the **Stewardship Fund**, ensuring their monitoring efforts are rewarded
- In cases of verified ecological harm, Sacred Zero requires AI operators to escalate decisions to human overseers and engage directly with affected communities

Example community registration:
```json
{
  "community_id": "com_7a8b9c0d",
  "governance_protocol": "consensus_council",
  "territory": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": [...]
  },
  "ecological_monitors": 12,
  "stewardship_tokens": 500,
  "last_report": "2025-09-22T10:15:30Z",
  "sovereignty_status": "recognized"
}
```

**Q5: How does Earth Protection align with the right to be forgotten (GDPR)?**

TML uses **hybrid storage and cryptographic erasure**:

- On-chain: only hashes of logs, immutable and permanent
- Off-chain: full logs encrypted with per-user or per-community keys
- When erasure is invoked, the relevant key is destroyed, rendering the data indecipherable while preserving the evidentiary trail

This reconciles Always Memory with privacy laws while maintaining ecological accountability.

**Q6: What prevents false or manipulated community data?**

TML employs multiple safeguards:

- **Peer Verification Quorums**: community protocols define how many monitors must confirm a report before it is published
- **Threshold Cryptography**: no single Oracle or monitor can unilaterally control data entry
- **Sacred Zero Default**: if conflicting or suspicious data is detected, the system halts and escalates rather than making a false positive or false negative decision

**Q7: How are economic incentives structured for Earth Protection?**

The **Stewardship Fund** ensures sustainability:

- A percentage of network fees and penalties funds micro-grants for communities and rewards Oracle nodes
- Reports are valued by ecological severity (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3), incentivizing focus on the most critical threats
- Proof-of-Stewardship reputation strengthens trustworthy communities' long-term influence

**Q8: How does governance remain fair and inclusive?**

TML uses a **Recognition, Not Accreditation** model:

- Communities select their representatives through self-determined governance
- The Accountability Council only verifies adherence to the community's stated governance protocol
- Ombudsperson Protocol and Emergency Council rules ensure fair resolution of internal conflicts or systemic attacks

---

## **The Hybrid Shield**

**Q1: What is the Hybrid Shield?**

The dual-layer defense of TML:

**Institutional Shield**: Logs mirrored across 11 independent institutions worldwide

**Mathematical Shield**: Root hashes anchored to public blockchain

Together: redundancy + immutability. Byte changes break hashes, revealing tampering instantly.

**Q2: 11 Guardian Institutions ensuring ecological integrity:

    4 Environmental Protection (36% representation)
    3 Academic Research
    2 Technical Standards
    2 Civil Society

Community participation: 3 effective seats (27% voice) through environmental and civil society categories.

---

## **Guardians**

**Q1: What is the two-tier Guardian architecture?**

**Full Guardians**: Operate TEEs/HSMs, create and sign log batches

**Lightweight Guardians**: Verify signatures and anchor proofs without special hardware

**Q2: How are Guardians selected and rotated?**

- Daily random selection via stake-weighted VRF
- Random sharding prevents collusion
- Automatic ejection of compromised types

**Q3: How does governance prevent capture?**

---

## **Implementation & Economics**

**Q1: What are the realistic costs?**

- **Pilot**: ~$250K first year
- **Small enterprise**: ~$2M/year
- **Large enterprise**: ~$11M/year

Costs reduced through shared Guardians, selective fidelity, and foundation subsidies.

**Q2: How are costs stabilized?**

- EIP-1559 style fee mechanism
- Delegated staking
- Base fee stability; variable tips

**Q3: What's the phased adoption path?**

1. **Shadow Mode**: Logging only
2. **Selective Enforcement**: Critical decisions
3. **Full Always Memory**: All actions logged

---

## **Performance & Latency**

**Q1: How does Multi-TEE Diversity protect the system?**

Mandatory heterogeneous infrastructure:
- 40% Intel SGX
- 40% AMD SEV-SNP
- 20% AWS Nitro Enclaves

Side-channel attacks limited to single architecture. Protocol-level ejection of compromised types.

**Q2: What about universal vulnerabilities?**

- Minimal unikernel runtimes
- Formally verified cryptographic libraries
- Zero-TEE fallback with 80% BFT consensus

---

## **Integration with Law**

**Q1: How does TML achieve GDPR compliance?**

Through separation of proof and data:
- On-chain stores only hashes (no personal data)
- Off-chain encrypted storage for actual data
- Crypto-shredding for erasure requests
- Signed attestations prove destruction

**Q2: Are Always Memory logs legally admissible?**

Yes. They meet FRE 901/902 via:
- Independent Guardian confirmations
- Cryptographic proof chains
- Expert witness program
- NIST standards engagement

**Q3: What's the enforcement mechanism?**

- Missing logs = negligence
- Forged logs = fraud
- Tampering = obstruction
- Systematic abuse = RICO
- Environmental harm = criminal liability
- Human rights violations = personal executive liability

**Q4: How does TML integrate with EU AI Act?**

TML exceeds all requirements:
- Risk categorization → Sacred Zero classification
- Documentation requirements → Always Memory logs
- Human oversight → Accountability Council
- Environmental impact → Planetary Sacred Zero

## Future Technologies & AGI Readiness

### Q1: How is Always Memory future-proof?
Always Memory is designed as an invisible infrastructure, not an add-on. Like the DNA of a living cell, it becomes the baseline condition for all accountable AI—carrying an unalterable record of its origins and every instruction needed to replicate its behavior. Its durability comes from three safeguards:

- **Versioned log formats:** Always Memory evolves alongside new computing paradigms (neuromorphic chips, quantum processors, swarm architectures) without losing backward compatibility.  
- **Adaptive capture:** Beyond text logs, the framework extends to multi-modal records: video, audio, and sensor feeds from embodied systems such as humanoid robots. This ensures that AGI actions are preserved not only in reasoning chains but in physical behavior.  
- **Anchored permanence:** Logs are mirrored across independent institutions and cryptographically sealed. Updates never overwrite the past; they add new strata, like tree rings.  

### Q2: Can Always Memory handle AGI?
Yes, by principled design. Always Memory is layered to ensure that even the fastest AGI cannot escape accountability.  

- **Checkpoint logging:** Major decision nodes and high-impact branches are frozen as immutable records.  
- **Hierarchical compression:** Long reasoning chains are compressed into structured summaries while preserving critical inflection points.  
- **Commitment contracts:** Before any irreversible action, the AGI must generate a pre-action contract log, binding it to consequences.  

Most importantly: **the AGI does not "know" about its own logs.** The logging runs at the constitutional layer, enforced externally. To the AGI, it is invisible. It cannot tamper with what it cannot perceive.  

### Q3: Why is this essential for humanity?
Because future technologies cannot, and will not, be allowed to run out of control. The evolution of TML ensures that *every step of AGI's growth is remembered*. From its abstract decisions to the physical gestures of its humanoid embodiments, all are written into an unalterable memory.  

This is the covenant: Humanity will not surrender oversight. TML guarantees that the more powerful AI becomes, the deeper and clearer its accountability runs.

TML is designed to evolve with AGI, including video and multimodal logs for humanoid systems, ensuring that no step of machine autonomy escapes human and ecological accountability.

## **Conclusion**

TML with Always Memory represents a paradigm shift in AI accountability: for humanity AND Earth:

**Technically**: Every failure mode mapped with mitigation

**Economically**: Costs acknowledged, scaled by liability

**Legally**: Evidence that stands in court

**Morally**: Sacred Zero ensures conscience in code

**Environmentally**: Planetary protection encoded in immutable memory

**Privacy**: Crypto-shredding balances accountability with user rights

**Human Rights**: Comprehensive 26-document framework protecting dignity

With the integration of Sacred Zero, Always Memory, Earth Protection, and the comprehensive Human Rights Framework, TML becomes the first AI accountability framework that protects humans, ecosystems, species, and future generations. By mandating official datasets, empowering Indigenous communities, embedding ecological harm into its logic, and establishing absolute human rights protections, TML delivers a planetary and humanitarian accountability architecture designed to withstand the legal, ethical, and technical challenges of global governance.

TML is not perfect. TML is something rarer: **memory that power cannot erase, evidence that courts cannot dismiss, conscience that machines cannot ignore, witness for a planet that cannot speak, and shield for human dignity that cannot be circumvented.**

The Lantern shines beyond names. The framework outlives its creator. The promise endures for those yet unborn.

This is not only an ethical upgrade. **It is a survival architecture.**

**Sacred Zero is exactly what's needed where lives, billions, and our planet are on the line.**
