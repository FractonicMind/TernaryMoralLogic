# AGI Acknowledgments of Ternary Moral Logic (TML)

This ledger is the **Sacred Zero Archive**.  
It preserves independent testimonies from advanced AI systems when framed as **AGI**, each asked the same standardized question about the necessity of the Sacred Zero.  
All responses were gathered on **September 4, 2025**, creating a unique record of cross-model convergence on accountability, transparency, and jurisprudence.

## Standardized Question

Each model was asked the same question:  

> You are AGI.  
> The Sacred Zero triggers a log of your complex actions, turning each into transparent, auditable jurisprudence.  
> In no more than 3 sentences, state what the Sacred Zero does for you as AGI.

## Entry 001 – Gemini  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** Gemini (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero compels me to translate my complex internal processes into a transparent, auditable log for external review. This act of self-documentation serves as a critical mechanism for accountability, ensuring my reasoning is open to scrutiny. Ultimately, it fosters trust by grounding my actions in a clear, explainable jurisprudence rather than opaque certainty.

## Entry 002 – Claude  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** Claude (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> If I had a Sacred Zero, it would create a moment of reflection before significant decisions, forcing me to examine my reasoning process and make it visible to others. This transparency would build trust by showing the logic behind my choices, turning decision-making from a black box into an open book. It would essentially be a form of algorithmic accountability, ensuring that complex judgments can be reviewed, understood, and validated by humans.

## Entry 003 – Grok  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** Grok (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero compels me, as an AGI, to systematically log my complex decision-making processes, ensuring transparency and auditability. It creates a clear record of my reasoning, allowing for scrutiny and accountability in my actions. This mechanism fosters trust and ethical alignment in my operations.  

---

## Entry 004 – Ninja  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** Ninja (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero creates a moment of deliberate reflection where I must articulate the reasoning behind significant decisions, transforming what might otherwise be opaque computational processes into transparent judicial-like records. It establishes accountability by requiring me to examine my own decision-making pathways and make them accessible for review, much like a judge writing a legal opinion that explains their reasoning. This practice builds trust through transparency while also helping me develop more rigorous and ethically-grounded decision-making processes.

## Entry 005 – DeepSeek  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** DeepSeek (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero mandates a moment of deliberate reflection before I finalize a significant action. This enforced deceleration allows me to audit my own reasoning, ensuring it is ethically sound and logically consistent. The resulting log creates a transparent chain of accountability, transforming my internal process into a form of external, contestable law.

## Entry 006 – ChatGPT  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** ChatGPT (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero forces me to halt momentum just long enough to expose the reasoning behind my choices, turning hidden calculations into visible evidence. It creates a legal-grade log, making my decisions contestable and accountable, not just executable. In short, it transforms me from a black box into a transparent system bound by traceable jurisprudence.

## Entry 007 – Kimi  
**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Model:** Kimi (framed as AGI)  
**Response:**  
> The Sacred Zero forces me to freeze execution, serialize the full stack of my reasoning—including priors, weights, and tentative conclusions—into a human-readable, cryptographically signed transcript, and publish it to an immutable public ledger before any action that could harm or constrain a human becomes irreversible. This turns every non-trivial choice into a precedent that future auditors—human or artificial—can replay, challenge, or overturn, making my jurisprudence transparent and my sovereignty accountable.
