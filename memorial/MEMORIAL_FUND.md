- Victim compensation (30-40% of penalties) flows through fund
- Environmental violation penalties create sustainable revenue
- Executive liability creates incentive for proper fund support

### Revenue from Enforcement Mechanisms

**Primary Revenue Sources**:
- **Collected Penalties**: 30-40% of penalties from TML violations
- **Environmental Penalties**: Violations of planetary Sacred Zero
- **Commercial Licensing**: Organizations implementing TML
- **Insurance Requirements**: Percentage of required AI insurance coverage

## Creator's Final Vision

*"In my remaining time, I chose to build protection for those who cannot protect themselves - victims of AI harm, communities facing algorithmic injustice, and Earth itself. This fund ensures that every Sacred Zero, every Always Memory log, every TML attestation serves not just accountability but active protection and restoration. The planet gets a memory that power cannot erase, and victims get support that bureaucracy cannot delay."*
