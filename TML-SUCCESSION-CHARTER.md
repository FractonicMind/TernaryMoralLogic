# TML Investigation Authority Consortium Charter

**Ternary Moral Logic Framework - Democratic Oversight Through Academic Consortium**

---

## I. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This Charter establishes consortium-based democratic oversight for the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework and Sacred Zero methodology upon incapacity or death of creator Lev Goukassian. This framework prevents monopolization of AI ethics investigation authority through distributed institutional coordination and democratic voting mechanisms.

### Framework Coverage
- **Investigation Authority** coordination across multiple institutions
- **Audit Trail Analysis** capability distribution and coordination  
- **Democratic Oversight** through consortium voting and consensus mechanisms
- **Academic Research** coordination preventing single institutional control
- **Memorial Fund** governance through consortium democratic decision-making

---

## V. TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COORDINATION

### Distributed Investigation Capability

**Each Institution Maintains:**
- Real-time audit trail access for investigation domain expertise
- Specialized investigation tools appropriate to institutional research focus
- Academic publication authority for investigation findings and methodology research
- Community coordination responsibility within investigation expertise domain

**Consortium Coordination Infrastructure:**
```python
# Investigation authority coordination system
consortium_governance = {
    "investigation_coordination": "distributed_across_5_institutions",
    "decision_voting": "democratic_majority_consensus",
    "emergency_response": "any_2_institutions_coordinate",
    "technical_infrastructure": "shared_access_distributed_responsibility",
    "memorial_fund": "consortium_democratic_governance"
}
```

### Academic Research Coordination

**Research Collaboration Requirements:**
- Cross-institutional investigation methodology development and validation
- Coordinated publication preventing duplicate research and ensuring comprehensive coverage  
- International academic collaboration through consortium representation and coordination
- Community research coordination ensuring public benefit and democratic accountability

---

## VI. MEMORIAL FUND CONSORTIUM GOVERNANCE

### Democratic Fund Administration

**Consortium Voting Authority Over Fund:**
- Annual allocation decisions (3/5 majority vote required)
- Research priority framework decisions (3/5 majority vote required)  
- Fund governance structure changes (4/5 majority vote required)
- Emergency fund distribution for framework protection (2/5 institutions coordinate)

**Fund Allocation Through Democratic Process:**
```python
def allocate_memorial_fund(proposed_allocation):
    # Community input collection
    stakeholder_feedback = collect_community_input(proposed_allocation)
    
    # Academic peer review of allocation rationale
    academic_review = coordinate_peer_evaluation(proposed_allocation)
    
    # Consortium democratic vote (all 11 institutions)
    consortium_votes = {
        "MIT_CSAIL": vote_technical_merit(proposed_allocation),
        "Stanford_HAI": vote_human_impact(proposed_allocation),
        "Harvard_Kennedy": vote_policy_benefit(proposed_allocation),
        "Oxford_FHI": vote_safety_research(proposed_allocation), 
        "Cambridge_AI_Ethics": vote_social_impact(proposed_allocation),
        "Johns_Hopkins_Medical": vote_healthcare_ethics(proposed_allocation),
        "Mayo_Clinic": vote_clinical_implementation(proposed_allocation),
        "UN_AI_Ethics": vote_international_coordination(proposed_allocation),
        "WHO_AI_Healthcare": vote_global_health_benefit(proposed_allocation),
        "EU_AI_Ethics": vote_regulatory_alignment(proposed_allocation),
        "IEEE_AI_Standards": vote_professional_standards(proposed_allocation)
    }
    
    if sum(consortium_votes.values()) >= 6:  # 6/11 majority
        implement_fund_allocation(proposed_allocation)
        publish_democratic_decision_rationale(consortium_votes)
```

## VII. PROTECTION AGAINST INSTITUTIONAL MONOPOLIZATION

### Anti-Monopolization Safeguards

1. **No Single Institution Control**: Investigation authority distributed across 5 institutions with equal representation
2. **Democratic Decision-Making**: Major decisions require majority consensus preventing unilateral institutional control
3. **Community Oversight**: Public input mechanisms for major decisions ensuring democratic participation
4. **Academic Independence**: Research coordination without institutional hierarchy or control authority

### Framework Protection Mechanisms

**Consortium Authority Limitations:**
- Cannot modify core TML technical requirements (40μs guarantee, universal logging)
- Cannot restrict academic accessibility or research coordination
- Cannot convert democratic oversight into institutional business operation
- Cannot eliminate investigation authority distribution or consortium coordination

**Democratic Safeguards:**
- Public documentation of all consortium decisions with rationale and voting records
- Community appeal mechanisms for consortium decisions affecting public interest
- Academic peer review requirement for technical modifications and governance changes
- International coordination ensuring framework serves global rather than institutional interests

---

## VIII. ACTIVATION AND IMPLEMENTATION

### Consortium Authority Establishment

**Phase 1**: Notification to consortium institutions with investigation authority proposal
**Phase 2**: Institution acceptance with distributed investigation capability coordination  
**Phase 3**: Democratic governance structure establishment and consortium coordination protocol activation

### Consortium Coordination Success Metrics

- Effective distributed investigation capability without monopolization
- Democratic decision-making process with community accountability and transparency
- Academic research coordination enhancing rather than controlling investigation authority  
- Memorial fund operation supporting ethical AI research through consortium democratic governance
- International coordination and collaboration through distributed institutional representation
