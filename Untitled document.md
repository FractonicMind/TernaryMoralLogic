Ternary Moral Logic (TML) is a **universal accountability framework** for AI that acts as a constitutional layer for machines. It is built on three core states: **\+1 (Proceed)** for routine actions, **0 (Sacred Zero)** for ethically complex actions, and **\-1 (Refuse)** for unsafe or malicious actions. The framework's foundation is **Always Memory**, which mandates that every AI action must create an immutable, cryptographically sealed record before execution, essentially operating on a "no memory \= no action" principle. This system shifts the paradigm from subjective "Explainable AI (XAI)" to evidence-based "Auditable AI (AAI)".

#### **Key Components of TML**

* **Sacred Zero**: This is a programmed hesitation or "circuit breaker" that triggers when moral complexity is detected. It applies to decisions affecting both humans and the planet. When triggered, the system pauses, requests confirmation from a human or council, and logs all outcomes.  
* **Always Memory**: This component ensures every AI action is logged with a cryptographically sealed, timestamped record. The logs are not optional and include detailed information such as timestamps, model hashes, classifications, and environmental impact metrics. This creates immutable evidence that can be used in courts.  
* **Earth Protection**: TML extends its accountability framework to include ecological harm, treating it as a form of moral harm. Sacred Zero triggers when actions threaten ecosystems, biodiversity, or environmental integrity. The framework requires AI operators to align models with official ecological baselines like the Paris Agreement and also integrates data from Indigenous and local communities through a "Local Witness Layer". It also uses cryptographic erasure to balance privacy with accountability.

**Green Readiness Score: 100/100**

TML earns a score of 100 because it explicitly and fundamentally integrates environmental protection into its core logic, going beyond mere compliance. The framework's "Earth Protection" components are not optional; they are a mandatory part of its design.

1. **Planetary Sacred Zero**: It explicitly extends Sacred Zero to include planetary harm. The system must pause and seek review if an action threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, or long-term environmental integrity.  
2. **Mandatory Baselines**: TML mandates that AI operators train their models on official global and national ecological standards, preventing "cherry-picking" or "greenwashing".  
3. **Accountability for Future Generations**: The framework is designed to be a "witness statement" for the planet, creating immutable logs that can be used to hold entities accountable for environmental harm across generations. This is described as "intergenerational justice encoded in immutable logs".  
4. **Empowerment of Stakeholders**: TML formally expands the definition of stakeholders to include non-human entities and future generations. It also empowers Indigenous and ethnic groups as "data stewards" of their ecosystems, rewarding their monitoring efforts through a Stewardship Fund.  
5. **Technical Implementation**: The framework logs specific environmental impact metrics, such as carbon equivalency, water consumption, and habitat affected. It also provides a robust mechanism to prevent false or manipulated data through peer verification and threshold cryptography.
